  abstract = {Granola is a baked aggregated food product which serves as a breakfast cereal or snack consisting of oats, cereals, nuts and honey. Particle breakage of aggregated granola can occur during conveying as product is transferred as part of the production process on its way to packaging. Such breakage occurs as a result of particle\textendash particle and particle\textendash wall collisions with the conveying equipment. In this work, a population balance model is developed to describe the breakage of granola as it is conveyed through a pneumatic conveying pipeline rig. The model incorporates the influence of conveying pressure, exposure time and pipeline geometry, and is also related to parameters associated with aggregate formation such as granulator mixing speed and time. The aggregates were formed in a high shear granulator subject to impeller agitation of 300rpm for 9min and were then propelled through a pipeline with a 90\textdegree{} bend at a number of different flow rates. Trials were carried out by applying compressed air at pressures of 200kPa, 300kPa and 400kPa while the aggregates were subjected to a number of recycles through the rig. Modelling of this breakage process was achieved by constructing the population balance equations (PBEs) in the form of a mass balance on the granola aggregates. The solutions to the PBEs were obtained by means of discretization through the application of the Markov chain method. When the size range of the system was divided into an appropriate number of states, the Markov chain method for the population balances exhibited a reasonable approximation for predicting the particle size distribution (PSD) over time particularly during the initial rig cycles.},

Our research is motivated not only by the theoretical challenge of this data situation, but also by the actual question of dynamics of implied volatility (IV) functions. For different maturities the log-returns of IVs are samples of (smooth) random functions and the methods proposed here study the similarities of their stochastic behavior. First we present a new method for estimation of functional principal components from discrete noisy data. Next we present the two sample inference for FPCA and develop the two sample theory. We propose bootstrap tests for testing the equality of eigenvalues, eigenfunctions, and mean functions of two functional samples, illustrate the test-properties by simulation study and apply the method to the IV analysis.},

This problem arises particularly in the analysis of longitudinal data in which some behavior of a number of subjects is measured at a number of points in time. In such cases information about the behavior of one or more derivatives of the function being sampled can often be very useful, as for example in the analysis of growth or learning curves. It is shown that the use of derivative information is equivalent to a change of metric for the row space in classical principal components analysis. The reproducing kernel for the Hilbert space of functions plays a central role, and defines the best interpolating functions, which are generalized spline functions. An example is offered of how sensitivity to derivative information can reveal interesting aspects of the data.},

In this paper, we study optimal estimation of the mean function under both common and independent designs. Minimax rates of convergence are established and easily implementable rate-optimal estimators are introduced. The analysis reveals interesting and different phase transition phenomena in the two cases. Under the common design, the sampling frequency solely determines the optimal rate of convergence when it is relatively small and the sampling frequency has no effect on the optimal rate when it is large. On the other hand, under the independent design, the optimal rate of convergence is determined jointly by the sampling frequency and the number of curves when the sampling frequency is relatively small. When it is large, the sampling frequency has no effect on the optimal rate. Another interesting contrast between the two settings is that smoothing is necessary under the independent design, while, somewhat surprisingly, it is not essential under the common design.},

In the literature there are a number of methods to solve PBEs including discrete methods, Monte Carlo simulation, and method of moments. In this paper, the Markov chain is presented as a discrete solution for a population balance equation of a breakage process for determining the particle size distribution (PSD) over time. The transition matrix P, which is the key operator of a Markov chain, is built using breakage equations. Thereafter, from calculating transition matrix, P, the particle size distribution of the system is easily evaluated using the Markov chain. According to simulation results, if the size range of the system is divided into a sufficient number of states and an appropriate transition time step was chosen, then results from the Markov chain are in agreement with the analytical solution of PBEs governed by the same breakage functions. In addition to theoretical illustration, the Markov theory was employed to model the breakage process of aggregated food products passing through a pneumatic conveying pipeline rig.},

This approach leads to a single set of multivariate functional principal component scores, which serve well as a proxy for multivariate functional data. We derive the consistency properties for the estimates of the mFPCn, and the asymptotic distributions for statistical inferences. We illustrate the finite sample performance of this approach through the analysis of a traffic flow data set, including an application to clustering and a simulation study.

  abstract = {Existing approaches for multivariate functional principal component analysis are restricted to data on the same one-dimensional interval. The presented approach focuses on multivariate functional data on different domains that may differ in dimension, such as functions and images. The theoretical basis for multivariate functional principal component analysis is given in terms of a Karhunen\textendash Lo\`eve Theorem. For the practically relevant case of a finite Karhunen\textendash Lo\`eve representation, a relationship between univariate and multivariate functional principal component analysis is established. This offers an estimation strategy to calculate multivariate functional principal components and scores based on their univariate counterparts. For the resulting estimators, asymptotic results are derived. The approach can be extended to finite univariate expansions in general, not necessarily orthonormal bases. It is also applicable for sparse functional data or data with measurement error. A flexible R implementation is available on CRAN. The new method is shown to be competitive to existing approaches for data observed on a common one-dimensional domain. The motivating application is a neuroimaging study, where the goal is to explore how longitudinal trajectories of a neuropsychological test score covary with FDG-PET brain scans at baseline. Supplementary material, including detailed proofs, additional simulation results, and software is available online.},

  abstract = {A method for generating theoretical breakage distribution functions for multiple particle breakage is presented. It starts with the joint probability function that accounts for all the child particles; it is then reduced to the marginal probability function commonly used in the breakage equation. This method is flexible enough to allow the user to choose the number of child particles and the functional form to be used. The method is demonstrated with both product and summation functions with a power-law form. To facilitate the use of these theoretical functions for statistical analyses, a companion discretized breakage equation is developed. The new equation guarantees the conservation of mass and correct prediction of the total number of particles despite discretization. It is easy to use because it is a set of ordinary differential equations and applicable to both equal-size and geometric-size intervals. Simulation results show that different breakage distribution functions coupled with different breakage rates can produce almost indistinguishable particle-size distributions, signifying the need for further work in this area.},

  abstract = {Bayesian parameter estimates for a computationally expensive multi-response jet-milling model are computed using the Metropolis\textendash Hastings and Wang\textendash Landau Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling algorithms. The model is accompanied by data obtained from 74 experiments at different process settings which is used to estimate the model parameters. The experimentally measured quantities are the 10th, 50th and 90th quantiles of the resulting particle size distributions. Parameter estimation is performed on a population balance jet-milling model composed of three subprocesses: jet expansion, milling and classification. The model contains eight parameters requiring estimation and can compute the same quantities that are determined in the experiments. As the model is computationally expensive to solve, the sampling algorithms are applied to a surrogate model to establish algorithm specific parameters and to obtain model parameter estimates. The resulting parameter estimates are given with a discussion of their reliability and the observed behaviour of the two sampling algorithms. Comparison of the autocorrelation function between samples generated by the two algorithms shows that the Wang\textendash Landau algorithm exhibits more rapid decay. Trace plots of the parameter samples from the two algorithms appear to be analogous and encourage the supposition that the Markov Chains have converged to the distribution of interest. One- and two-dimensional density plots indicate a unimodal distribution for all parameters, which suggests that the obtained estimates are unique. The two-dimensional density plots also suggest correlation between at least two of the model parameters. The realised distribution generated by both algorithms produced consistent results and demonstrated similar behaviour. For the application considered in this work, the Wang\textendash Landau algorithm is found to exhibit superior performance with respect to the correlation and equivalent performance in all other respects.},

Here, we show how one can use Bayesian inversion to obtain statistical estimates for the parameters that appear in recently derived mechanism-enabled population balance models (ME-PBM) of nanoparticle growth. The Bayesian approach addresses the question of ``how well do we know our parameters, along with their uncertainties?.'' The results reveal that Bayesian inversion statistical analysis on an example, prototype nanoparticle formation system allows one to estimate not just the most likely rate constants and other parameter values, but also their SDs, confidence intervals, and other statistical information. Moreover, knowing the reliability of the mechanistic model's parameters in turn helps inform one about the reliability of the proposed mechanism, as well as the reliability of its predictions. The paper can also be seen as a tutorial with the additional goal of achieving a ``Gold Standard'' Bayesian inversion ME-PBM benchmark that others can use as a control to check their own use of this methodology for other systems of interest throughout nature. Overall, the results provide strong support for the hypothesis that there is substantial value in using a Bayesian inversion methodology for parameter estimation in particle formation systems.},

  abstract = {Computational fluid dynamics simulations in practical industrial/environmental cases often involve non-homogeneous concentrations of particles. In Euler\textendash Lagrange simulations, this can induce the propagation of numerical error when the number of collision/agglomeration events is computed using mean-field approaches. In fact, mean-field statistical collision models allow to sample the number of collision events using a priori information on the frequency of collisions (the collision kernel). Yet, since such methods often rely on the mesh used for the Eulerian simulation of the fluid phase, the particle number concentration within a given cell might not be homogeneous, leading to numerical errors. In this article, we apply the data-driven spatial decomposition (D2SD) algorithm to control such error in simulations of particle agglomeration. Significant improvements are made to design a fast D2SD version, minimising the additional computational cost by developing re-meshing criteria. Through the application to some practical simulation cases, we show the importance of splitting the domain when computing agglomeration events in Euler/Lagrange simulations, so that within each elementary cell there is a spatially uniform distribution of particles.},

Three strategies were applied to the drawing of parameters, evaluating the correlation between the parameters of the models. An adaptive tolerance in each population and a stopping criterion, based on Morozov's uncertainty principle, were used for the algorithm. The technique obtained reasonable estimates for the phenomenological rates of the models. The algorithm correctly selected the model used for generating measurements, and the three draw strategies demonstrated good applicability. The results obtained showed that the algorithm presented accuracy and precision in estimating the parameters and properly selected the models analyzed.},

  abstract = {Numerical modeling of non-inertial particles dynamics is usually addressed by solving a population balance equation (PBE). In addition to space and time, a discretization is required also in the particle-size space, covering a large range of variation controlled by strongly nonlinear phenomena. A novel approach is presented in which a hybrid stochastic/fixed-sectional method solving the PBE is used to train a combination of an artificial neural network (ANN) with a convolutional neural network (CNN) and recurrent long short-term memory artificial neural layers. The hybrid stochastic/fixed-sectional method decomposes the problem into the total number density and the probability density function of sizes, allowing for an accurate treatment of surface growth/loss. After solving for the transport of species and temperature, the input of the ANN is composed of the thermochemical parameters controlling the particle physics and of the increment in time. The input of the CNN is the shape of the particle size distribution (PSD) discretized in sections of size. From these inputs, in a flow simulation, the ANN\textendash CNN returns the PSD shape for the subsequent time step or a source term for the Eulerian transport of the particle size density. The method is evaluated in a canonical laminar premixed sooting flame of the literature, and for a given level of accuracy (i.e., a given discretization of the size space), a significant computing cost reduction is achieved (six times faster compared to a sectional method with ten sections and 30 times faster for 100 sections).},

  abstract = {We introduce a sparse multivariate functional principal component analysis method by incorporating ideas from the group sparse maximum variance method to multivariate functional data. Our method can avoid the ``curse of dimensionality'' from a high-dimensional dataset and enjoy interpretability at the same time. In particular, our unsupervised method can capture important latent factors to explain variability of the dataset, which can induce a clear distinction between important variables in the principal components and unnecessary features based on the sparseness structure. Furthermore, our method can be applied to functional data from a multidimensional domain that hinges on different intervals. In the numerical experiment, we show that our method works well in both low- and high-dimensional multivariate functional data regardless of the number and the type of basis. We further apply our method to stock market data and electroencephalography data in an alcoholism study to demonstrate the theoretical result.},

  abstract = {A general formulation for the statistical description of time-dependent multiple particle breakage processes is presented in terms of a purposely constructed dimensionless quantity that contains the main physical magnitudes involved in the problem. The approach combines the Tsallis non-extensive entropy with a kinetic equation with fractionary index for the time evolution of the size/mass of the fragments. The obtained distribution function is tested by fitting some experimental reports. It is found that the better adjustment corresponds, in all cases, to values of the time index equal or below 0.6, whereas the parameter of nonextensivity ranks between 1 and 2, as previously reported in other studies involving some kind of fragmentation. The work could be the first example of a non-extensive maximum-entropy statistical description based on a purposely constructed dimensionless quantity, as well as of the derivation of a fragment size distribution function explicitly dependent on measurable system variables. As a result, the role of quantities such as viscosity, velocity gradient and others becomes explicit in the formulation.},

  abstract = {This study presents a new method for solving the population balance equation (PBE) for particle coagulation. The method introduces a radial basis function network to approximate the number density function. The approximate solution should satisfy the PBE at the collocation points in a continuous manner. The coagulation terms in the PBE are directly handled using the Gaussian quadrature techniques. The final solution is a bivariant analytical function of particle volume and time, which can be easily used in any subsequent calculation. Then the method is validated by comparing with analytical solutions and the sectional method for four numerical test problems. These problems are selected to vary in coagulation kernels and initial conditions. The comparative results show that the present method can accurately predict the time evolution of the number density function. Moreover, the computational efficiency of the present method is quite acceptable considering the high accuracy.Copyright \textcopyright{} 2020 American Association for Aerosol Research},

  abstract = {Sporting performance is often investigated through graphical observation of key technical variables that are representative of whole movements. The presence of differences between athletes in such variables has led to terms such as movement signatures being used. These signatures can be multivariate (multiple time-series observed concurrently), and also be composed of variables measured relative to different scales. Analytical techniques from areas of statistics such as Functional Data Analysis (FDA) present a practical alternative for analysing multivariate signatures. When applied to concurrent bivariate time-series multivariate functional principal components analysis (referred to as bivariate fPCA or bfPCA in this paper) has demonstrated preliminary application in biomechanical contexts. Despite this, given the infancy of bfPCA in sports biomechanics there are still necessary considerations for its use with non-conventional or complex bivariate structures. This paper focuses on the application of bfPCA to the force-angle graph in on-water rowing, which is a bivariate structure composed of variables with different units. A normalisation approach is proposed to investigate and standardise differences in variability between the two variables. The results of bfPCA applied to the non-normalised data and normalised data are then compared. Considerations and recommendations for the application of bfPCA in this context are also provided.},

  abstract = {We propose a nonparametric method to perform functional principal components analysis for the case of sparse longitudinal data. The method aims at irregularly spaced longitudinal data, where the number of repeated measurements available per subject is small. In contrast, classical functional data analysis requires a large number of regularly spaced measurements per subject. We assume that the repeated measurements are located randomly with a random number of repetitions for each subject and are determined by an underlying smooth random (subject-specific) trajectory plus measurement errors. Basic elements of our approach are the parsimonious estimation of the covariance structure and mean function of the trajectories, and the estimation of the variance of the measurement errors. The eigenfunction basis is estimated from the data, and functional principal components score estimates are obtained by a conditioning step. This conditional estimation method is conceptually simple and straightforward to implement. A key step is the derivation of asymptotic consistency and distribution results under mild conditions, using tools from functional analysis. Functional data analysis for sparse longitudinal data enables prediction of individual smooth trajectories even if only one or few measurements are available for a subject. Asymptotic pointwise and simultaneous confidence bands are obtained for predicted individual trajectories, based on asymptotic distributions, for simultaneous bands under the assumption of a finite number of components. Model selection techniques, such as the Akaike information criterion, are used to choose the model dimension corresponding to the number of eigenfunctions in the model. The methods are illustrated with a simulation study, longitudinal CD4 data for a sample of AIDS patients, and time-course gene expression data for the yeast cell cycle.},

We investigate the performance of local linear smoothers for both mean and covariance functions with a general weighing scheme, which includes two commonly used schemes, equal weight per observation (OBS), and equal weight per subject (SUBJ), as two special cases. We provide a comprehensive analysis of their asymptotic properties on a unified platform for all types of sampling plan, be it dense, sparse or neither. Three types of asymptotic properties are investigated in this paper: asymptotic normality, \$L\^\{2\}\$ convergence and uniform convergence. The asymptotic theories are unified on two aspects: (1) the weighing scheme is very general; (2) the magnitude of the number \$N\_\{i\}\$ of measurements for the \$i\$th subject relative to the sample size \$n\$ can vary freely. Based on the relative order of \$N\_\{i\}\$ to \$n\$, functional data are partitioned into three types: non-dense, dense and ultra-dense functional data for the OBS and SUBJ schemes. These two weighing schemes are compared both theoretically and numerically. We also propose a new class of weighing schemes in terms of a mixture of the OBS and SUBJ weights, of which theoretical and numerical performances are examined and compared.},

  abstract = {With modern technology development, functional data are being observed frequently in many scientific fields. A popular method for analyzing such functional data is ``smoothing first, then estimation.'' That is, statistical inference such as estimation and hypothesis testing about functional data is conducted based on the substitution of the underlying individual functions by their reconstructions obtained by one smoothing technique or another. However, little is known about this substitution effect on functional data analysis. In this paper this problem is investigated when the local polynomial kernel (LPK) smoothing technique is used for individual function reconstructions. We find that under some mild conditions, the substitution effect can be ignored asymptotically. Based on this, we construct LPK reconstruction-based estimators for the mean, covariance and noise variance functions of a functional data set and derive their asymptotics. We also propose a GCV rule for selecting good bandwidths for the LPK reconstructions. When the mean function also depends on some time-independent covariates, we consider a functional linear model where the mean function is linearly related to the covariates but the covariate effects are functions of time. The LPK reconstruction-based estimators for the covariate effects and the covariance function are also constructed and their asymptotics are derived. Moreover, we propose a L2-norm-based global test statistic for a general hypothesis testing problem about the covariate effects and derive its asymptotic random expression. The effect of the bandwidths selected by the proposed GCV rule on the accuracy of the LPK reconstructions and the mean function estimator is investigated via a simulation study. The proposed methodologies are illustrated via an application to a real functional data set collected in climatology.},
