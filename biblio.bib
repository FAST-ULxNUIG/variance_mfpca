  abstract = {Granola is a baked aggregated food product which serves as a breakfast cereal or snack consisting of oats, cereals, nuts and honey. Particle breakage of aggregated granola can occur during conveying as product is transferred as part of the production process on its way to packaging. Such breakage occurs as a result of particle\textendash particle and particle\textendash wall collisions with the conveying equipment. In this work, a population balance model is developed to describe the breakage of granola as it is conveyed through a pneumatic conveying pipeline rig. The model incorporates the influence of conveying pressure, exposure time and pipeline geometry, and is also related to parameters associated with aggregate formation such as granulator mixing speed and time. The aggregates were formed in a high shear granulator subject to impeller agitation of 300rpm for 9min and were then propelled through a pipeline with a 90\textdegree{} bend at a number of different flow rates. Trials were carried out by applying compressed air at pressures of 200kPa, 300kPa and 400kPa while the aggregates were subjected to a number of recycles through the rig. Modelling of this breakage process was achieved by constructing the population balance equations (PBEs) in the form of a mass balance on the granola aggregates. The solutions to the PBEs were obtained by means of discretization through the application of the Markov chain method. When the size range of the system was divided into an appropriate number of states, the Markov chain method for the population balances exhibited a reasonable approximation for predicting the particle size distribution (PSD) over time particularly during the initial rig cycles.},

This problem arises particularly in the analysis of longitudinal data in which some behavior of a number of subjects is measured at a number of points in time. In such cases information about the behavior of one or more derivatives of the function being sampled can often be very useful, as for example in the analysis of growth or learning curves. It is shown that the use of derivative information is equivalent to a change of metric for the row space in classical principal components analysis. The reproducing kernel for the Hilbert space of functions plays a central role, and defines the best interpolating functions, which are generalized spline functions. An example is offered of how sensitivity to derivative information can reveal interesting aspects of the data.},

In this paper, the Markov chain is presented as a discrete solution for a population balance equation of a breakage process for determining the particle size distribution (PSD) over time. The transition matrix P, which is the key operator of a Markov chain, is built using breakage equations. Thereafter, from calculating transition matrix, P, the particle size distribution of the system is easily evaluated using the Markov chain. According to simulation results, if the size range of the system is divided into a sufficient number of states and an appropriate transition time step was chosen, then results from the Markov chain are in agreement with the analytical solution of PBEs governed by the same breakage functions. In addition to theoretical illustration, the Markov theory was employed to model the breakage process of aggregated food products passing through a pneumatic conveying pipeline rig.},

The key idea is to consider each functional curve as a point in a general function space and then project these points onto a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space with the aid of Regularization theory.

The presented approach focuses on multivariate functional data on different domains that may differ in dimension, such as functions and images. The theoretical basis for multivariate functional principal component analysis is given in terms of a Karhunen\textendash Lo\`eve Theorem. For the practically relevant case of a finite Karhunen\textendash Lo\`eve representation, a relationship between univariate and multivariate functional principal component analysis is established. This offers an estimation strategy to calculate multivariate functional principal components and scores based on their univariate counterparts. For the resulting estimators, asymptotic results are derived. The approach can be extended to finite univariate expansions in general, not necessarily orthonormal bases. It is also applicable for sparse functional data or data with measurement error. A flexible R implementation is available on CRAN. The new method is shown to be competitive to existing approaches for data observed on a common one-dimensional domain. The motivating application is a neuroimaging study, where the goal is to explore how longitudinal trajectories of a neuropsychological test score covary with FDG-PET brain scans at baseline. Supplementary material, including detailed proofs, additional simulation results, and software is available online.},

This method is flexible enough to allow the user to choose the number of child particles and the functional form to be used. The method is demonstrated with both product and summation functions with a power-law form. To facilitate the use of these theoretical functions for statistical analyses, a companion discretized breakage equation is developed. The new equation guarantees the conservation of mass and correct prediction of the total number of particles despite discretization. It is easy to use because it is a set of ordinary differential equations and applicable to both equal-size and geometric-size intervals. Simulation results show that different breakage distribution functions coupled with different breakage rates can produce almost indistinguishable particle-size distributions, signifying the need for further work in this area.},

The model is accompanied by data obtained from 74 experiments at different process settings which is used to estimate the model parameters. The experimentally measured quantities are the 10th, 50th and 90th quantiles of the resulting particle size distributions. Parameter estimation is performed on a population balance jet-milling model composed of three subprocesses: jet expansion, milling and classification. The model contains eight parameters requiring estimation and can compute the same quantities that are determined in the experiments. As the model is computationally expensive to solve, the sampling algorithms are applied to a surrogate model to establish algorithm specific parameters and to obtain model parameter estimates. The resulting parameter estimates are given with a discussion of their reliability and the observed behaviour of the two sampling algorithms. Comparison of the autocorrelation function between samples generated by the two algorithms shows that the Wang\textendash Landau algorithm exhibits more rapid decay. Trace plots of the parameter samples from the two algorithms appear to be analogous and encourage the supposition that the Markov Chains have converged to the distribution of interest. One- and two-dimensional density plots indicate a unimodal distribution for all parameters, which suggests that the obtained estimates are unique. The two-dimensional density plots also suggest correlation between at least two of the model parameters. The realised distribution generated by both algorithms produced consistent results and demonstrated similar behaviour. For the application considered in this work, the Wang\textendash Landau algorithm is found to exhibit superior performance with respect to the correlation and equivalent performance in all other respects.},

Here, we show how one can use Bayesian inversion to obtain statistical estimates for the parameters that appear in recently derived mechanism-enabled population balance models (ME-PBM) of nanoparticle growth. The Bayesian approach addresses the question of ``how well do we know our parameters, along with their uncertainties?.'' The results reveal that Bayesian inversion statistical analysis on an example, prototype nanoparticle formation system allows one to estimate not just the most likely rate constants and other parameter values, but also their SDs, confidence intervals, and other statistical information. Moreover, knowing the reliability of the mechanistic model's parameters in turn helps inform one about the reliability of the proposed mechanism, as well as the reliability of its predictions. The paper can also be seen as a tutorial with the additional goal of achieving a ``Gold Standard'' Bayesian inversion ME-PBM benchmark that others can use as a control to check their own use of this methodology for other systems of interest throughout nature. Overall, the results provide strong support for the hypothesis that there is substantial value in using a Bayesian inversion methodology for parameter estimation in particle formation systems.},

  abstract = {Computational fluid dynamics simulations in practical industrial/environmental cases often involve non-homogeneous concentrations of particles. In Euler\textendash Lagrange simulations, this can induce the propagation of numerical error when the number of collision/agglomeration events is computed using mean-field approaches. In fact, mean-field statistical collision models allow to sample the number of collision events using a priori information on the frequency of collisions (the collision kernel). Yet, since such methods often rely on the mesh used for the Eulerian simulation of the fluid phase, the particle number concentration within a given cell might not be homogeneous, leading to numerical errors. In this article, we apply the data-driven spatial decomposition (D2SD) algorithm to control such error in simulations of particle agglomeration. Significant improvements are made to design a fast D2SD version, minimising the additional computational cost by developing re-meshing criteria. Through the application to some practical simulation cases, we show the importance of splitting the domain when computing agglomeration events in Euler/Lagrange simulations, so that within each elementary cell there is a spatially uniform distribution of particles.},

The Gap statistic standardizes the graph of \$\textbackslash log(W\_\{k\})\$, where \$W\_\{k\}\$ is the within-cluster dispersion, by comparing it to its expectation under an appropriate null reference distribution of the data. We suggest to use \$W\_\{k\}\$ instead of \$\textbackslash log(W\_\{k\})\$, and to compare it to the expectation of \$W\_\{k\}\$ under a null reference distribution. In fact, whenever a number fulfills the original Gap statistic inequality, this number also fulfills the inequality of a Gap statistic using \$W\_\{k\}\$, but not \textbackslash textit\{vice versa\}. The two definitions of the Gap function are evaluated on several simulated data set and on a real data of DCE-MR images.},

  abstract = {Population balance models mathematically describe the particle size distribution based on modeling physical phenomena that influence the distribution, such as aggregation, growth, and breakage. Due to the wide range of mechanisms present, several models are presented in the literature since several hypotheses are considered. In the current work, the Approximate Bayesian Computational statistical technique was used to select four different models of population balance and estimate their parameters. Three strategies were applied to the drawing of parameters, evaluating the correlation between the parameters of the models. An adaptive tolerance in each population and a stopping criterion, based on Morozov's uncertainty principle, were used for the algorithm. The technique obtained reasonable estimates for the phenomenological rates of the models. The algorithm correctly selected the model used for generating measurements, and the three draw strategies demonstrated good applicability. The results obtained showed that the algorithm presented accuracy and precision in estimating the parameters and properly selected the models analyzed.},

Four members of the algorithm family have been numerically validated by comparison to analytic solutions to simple problems. Numerical experiments have been performed for complex laminar premixed flame systems in which members of the class of stochastic weighted particle methods were compared to each other and to a direct simulation algorithm. Two of the weighted algorithms have been shown to offer performance advantages over the direct simulation algorithm in situations where interest is focused on the larger particles in a system.

  abstract = {Numerical modeling of non-inertial particles dynamics is usually addressed by solving a population balance equation (PBE). In addition to space and time, a discretization is required also in the particle-size space, covering a large range of variation controlled by strongly nonlinear phenomena. A novel approach is presented in which a hybrid stochastic/fixed-sectional method solving the PBE is used to train a combination of an artificial neural network (ANN) with a convolutional neural network (CNN) and recurrent long short-term memory artificial neural layers. The hybrid stochastic/fixed-sectional method decomposes the problem into the total number density and the probability density function of sizes, allowing for an accurate treatment of surface growth/loss. After solving for the transport of species and temperature, the input of the ANN is composed of the thermochemical parameters controlling the particle physics and of the increment in time. The input of the CNN is the shape of the particle size distribution (PSD) discretized in sections of size. From these inputs, in a flow simulation, the ANN\textendash CNN returns the PSD shape for the subsequent time step or a source term for the Eulerian transport of the particle size density. The method is evaluated in a canonical laminar premixed sooting flame of the literature, and for a given level of accuracy (i.e., a given discretization of the size space), a significant computing cost reduction is achieved (six times faster compared to a sectional method with ten sections and 30 times faster for 100 sections).},

Population balance models are used to track particle properties and their changes due to aggregation, fragmentation, nucleation and growth, processes that directly affect the distribution of particle sizes. The population balance equation is an integro-partial differential equation whose domain is the line of positive real numbers. This poses challenges for the stability and accuracy of the numerical methods used to solve for size distribution function and in response to these challenges several different methodologies have been developed in the literature. This review provides a critical presentation of the state of the art in numerical approaches for solving these complex models with emphasis in the algorithmic details that distinguish each methodology.

The approach combines the Tsallis non-extensive entropy with a kinetic equation with fractionary index for the time evolution of the size/mass of the fragments. The obtained distribution function is tested by fitting some experimental reports. It is found that the better adjustment corresponds, in all cases, to values of the time index equal or below 0.6, whereas the parameter of nonextensivity ranks between 1 and 2, as previously reported in other studies involving some kind of fragmentation. The work could be the first example of a non-extensive maximum-entropy statistical description based on a purposely constructed dimensionless quantity, as well as of the derivation of a fragment size distribution function explicitly dependent on measurable system variables. As a result, the role of quantities such as viscosity, velocity gradient and others becomes explicit in the formulation.},

The method introduces a radial basis function network to approximate the number density function. The approximate solution should satisfy the PBE at the collocation points in a continuous manner. The coagulation terms in the PBE are directly handled using the Gaussian quadrature techniques. The final solution is a bivariant analytical function of particle volume and time, which can be easily used in any subsequent calculation. Then the method is validated by comparing with analytical solutions and the sectional method for four numerical test problems. These problems are selected to vary in coagulation kernels and initial conditions. The comparative results show that the present method can accurately predict the time evolution of the number density function. Moreover, the computational efficiency of the present method is quite acceptable considering the high accuracy.Copyright \textcopyright{} 2020 American Association for Aerosol Research},

  abstract = {With modern technology development, functional data are being observed frequently in many scientific fields. A popular method for analyzing such functional data is ``smoothing first, then estimation.'' That is, statistical inference such as estimation and hypothesis testing about functional data is conducted based on the substitution of the underlying individual functions by their reconstructions obtained by one smoothing technique or another. However, little is known about this substitution effect on functional data analysis. In this paper this problem is investigated when the local polynomial kernel (LPK) smoothing technique is used for individual function reconstructions. We find that under some mild conditions, the substitution effect can be ignored asymptotically. Based on this, we construct LPK reconstruction-based estimators for the mean, covariance and noise variance functions of a functional data set and derive their asymptotics. We also propose a GCV rule for selecting good bandwidths for the LPK reconstructions. When the mean function also depends on some time-independent covariates, we consider a functional linear model where the mean function is linearly related to the covariates but the covariate effects are functions of time. The LPK reconstruction-based estimators for the covariate effects and the covariance function are also constructed and their asymptotics are derived. Moreover, we propose a L2-norm-based global test statistic for a general hypothesis testing problem about the covariate effects and derive its asymptotic random expression. The effect of the bandwidths selected by the proposed GCV rule on the accuracy of the LPK reconstructions and the mean function estimator is investigated via a simulation study. The proposed methodologies are illustrated via an application to a real functional data set collected in climatology.},
