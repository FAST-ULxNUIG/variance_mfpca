Tensor decompositions, or higher-order principal components analysis (HOPCA), are a classical method for dimension reduction and pattern recognition for this multi-way data. In this paper, we introduce novel methods for Functional HOPCA that decompose the tensor data into components that are smooth with respect to the known data structure. Through numerical experiments we demonstrate the comparative advantages of our methods for smooth signal recovery from multi-way data.},

Although a significant result in a large study may sometimes not be clinically important, a far greater problem arises from misinterpretation of non-significant findings. By convention a P value greater than 5\% (P{$>$}0.05) is called “not significant.” Randomised controlled clinical trials that do not show a significant difference between the treatments being compared are often called “negative.” This term wrongly implies that the study has shown that there is no difference, whereas usually all that has been shown is an absence of evidence of a difference.

This article contributes to the research in this area by proposing a new stationarity test for functional time series based on frequency domain methods. The proposed test statistics is based on joint dimension reduction via functional principal components analysis across the spectral density operators at all Fourier frequencies, explicitly allowing for frequency-dependent levels of truncation to adapt to the dynamics of the underlying functional time series. The properties of the test are derived both under the null hypothesis of stationary functional time series and under the smooth alternative of locally stationary functional time series. The methodology is theoretically justified through asymptotic results. Evidence from simulation studies and an application to annual temperature curves suggests that the test works well in finite samples.},

  abstract = {Granola is a baked aggregated food product which serves as a breakfast cereal or snack consisting of oats, cereals, nuts and honey. Particle breakage of aggregated granola can occur during conveying as product is transferred as part of the production process on its way to packaging. Such breakage occurs as a result of particle–particle and particle–wall collisions with the conveying equipment. In this work, a population balance model is developed to describe the breakage of granola as it is conveyed through a pneumatic conveying pipeline rig. The model incorporates the influence of conveying pressure, exposure time and pipeline geometry, and is also related to parameters associated with aggregate formation such as granulator mixing speed and time. The aggregates were formed in a high shear granulator subject to impeller agitation of 300rpm for 9min and were then propelled through a pipeline with a 90° bend at a number of different flow rates. Trials were carried out by applying compressed air at pressures of 200kPa, 300kPa and 400kPa while the aggregates were subjected to a number of recycles through the rig. Modelling of this breakage process was achieved by constructing the population balance equations (PBEs) in the form of a mass balance on the granola aggregates. The solutions to the PBEs were obtained by means of discretization through the application of the Markov chain method. When the size range of the system was divided into an appropriate number of states, the Markov chain method for the population balances exhibited a reasonable approximation for predicting the particle size distribution (PSD) over time particularly during the initial rig cycles.},

For different maturities the log-returns of IVs are samples of (smooth) random functions and the methods proposed here study the similarities of their stochastic behavior. First we present a new method for estimation of functional principal components from discrete noisy data. Next we present the two sample inference for FPCA and develop the two sample theory. We propose bootstrap tests for testing the equality of eigenvalues, eigenfunctions, and mean functions of two functional samples, illustrate the test-properties by simulation study and apply the method to the IV analysis.},

Researchers from a variety of disciplines jumped at the opportunity to compare the rescheduled games, played in front of empty stadia, to previous games, played in front of fans. To date, most of this post-Covid soccer research has used linear regression models, or versions thereof, to estimate potential changes to the home advantage. However, we argue that leveraging the Poisson distribution would be more appropriate and use simulations to show that bivariate Poisson regression (Karlis and Ntzoufras in J R Stat Soc Ser D Stat 52(3):381–393, 2003) reduces absolute bias when estimating the home advantage benefit in a single season of soccer games, relative to linear regression, by almost 85\%. Next, with data from 17 professional soccer leagues, we extend bivariate Poisson models estimate the change in home advantage due to games being played without fans. In contrast to current research that suggests a drop in the home advantage, our findings are mixed; in some leagues, evidence points to a decrease, while in others, the home advantage may have risen. Altogether, this suggests a more complex causal mechanism for the impact of fans on sporting events.},

  abstract = {Mahalanobis distance is a classical tool in multivariate analysis. We suggest here an extension of this concept to the case of functional data. More precisely, the proposed definition concerns those statistical problems where the sample data are real functions defined on a compact interval of the real line. The obvious difficulty for such a functional extension is the non-invertibility of the covariance operator in infinite-dimensional cases. Unlike other recent proposals, our definition is suggested and motivated in terms of the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) associated with the stochastic process that generates the data. The proposed distance is a true metric; it depends on a unique real smoothing parameter which is fully motivated in RKHS terms. Moreover, it shares some properties of its finite dimensional counterpart: it is invariant under isometries, it can be consistently estimated from the data and its sampling distribution is known under Gaussian models. An empirical study for two statistical applications, outliers detection and binary classification, is included. The results are quite competitive when compared to other recent proposals in the literature.},

Data can be arranged in a matrix whose elements are functions so that for each individual a vector of p functions is observed. This set of p curves is reduced to a small number of transformed functions, retaining as much information as possible. The criterion to measure the information loss is the integrated variance. Under mild regular conditions, it is proved that if the original functions are smooth this property is inherited by the principal components. A numerical procedure to obtain the smooth principal components is proposed and the goodness of the dimension reduction is assessed by two new measures of the proportion of explained variability. The method performs as expected in various controlled simulated data sets and provides interesting conclusions when it is applied to real data sets.},

In such cases information about the behavior of one or more derivatives of the function being sampled can often be very useful, as for example in the analysis of growth or learning curves. It is shown that the use of derivative information is equivalent to a change of metric for the row space in classical principal components analysis. The reproducing kernel for the Hilbert space of functions plays a central role, and defines the best interpolating functions, which are generalized spline functions. An example is offered of how sensitivity to derivative information can reveal interesting aspects of the data.},

Such ratings are important complements to behavioral and physiological measurements of physical performance and work capacity.

Perceptual estimates, obtained by psychophysical ratio-scaling methods, are valid when describing general perceptual variation, but category methods are more useful in several applied situations when differences between individuals are described. A presentation is made of ratio-scaling methods, category methods, especially the Borg Scale for ratings of perceived exertion, and a new method that combines the category method with ratio properties.

  abstract = {Principal component analysis (PCA) can be seen as a singular value decomposition (SVD) of a column-centred data matrix. In a number of applications, no pre-processing of the data is carried out, and it is the uncentred data matrix that is subjected to an SVD, in what is often called an uncentred PCA. This paper explores the relationships between the results from both the standard, column-centred, PCA, and its uncentred counterpart. In particular, it obtains both exact results and bounds relating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covariation matrices, as well as the principal components, in both types of analysis. These relationships highlight how the eigenvalues of both the covariance matrix and the matrix of non-central second moments contain much information that is highly informative for a comparative assessment of PCA and its uncentred variant. The relations and the examples also suggest that the results of both types of PCA have more in common than might be supposed.},

In the literature there are a number of methods to solve PBEs including discrete methods, Monte Carlo simulation, and method of moments. In this paper, the Markov chain is presented as a discrete solution for a population balance equation of a breakage process for determining the particle size distribution (PSD) over time. The transition matrix P, which is the key operator of a Markov chain, is built using breakage equations. Thereafter, from calculating transition matrix, P, the particle size distribution of the system is easily evaluated using the Markov chain. According to simulation results, if the size range of the system is divided into a sufficient number of states and an appropriate transition time step was chosen, then results from the Markov chain are in agreement with the analytical solution of PBEs governed by the same breakage functions. In addition to theoretical illustration, the Markov theory was employed to model the breakage process of aggregated food products passing through a pneumatic conveying pipeline rig.},

  abstract = {Der technologische Fortschritt ermöglicht es heutigen Wissenschaftlern verschiedener Bereiche, zunehmend Daten zu erheben, die aus funktionalen Beobachtungen anstelle von einzelnen Datenpunkten bestehen. Intensive Forschung im Bereich der funktionalen Datenanalyse zielte in den letzten Jahren darauf ab, Methoden zu entwickeln, um das gesamte Potenzial dieser Art von Daten zu erschließen. Viele der vorgeschlagenen Methoden basieren auf der Annahme unabhängiger funktionaler Beobachtungen. In der Praxis kann dies eine große Einschränkung darstellen, da die funktionalen Beobachtungen häufig korreliert sind, beispielsweise aufgrund wiederholter Beobachtungen pro Subjekt oder Gruppierung in den Daten.  Der Schwerpunkt dieser Dissertation liegt auf der Analyse von funktionalen Daten mit komplexen Korrelationsstrukturen. Funktionale lineare gemischte Modelle, das funktionale Pendant zu skalaren linearen gemischten Modellen, werden verwendet um korrelierte funktionale Daten zu analysieren. Hierbei werden die zufälligen Effekte der skalaren linearen gemischten Modelle durch Funktionen ersetzt, die über den Träger der beobachteten Daten variieren. Zusätzlich zu der Annahme unabhängiger funktionaler Beobachtungen setzen die meisten bestehenden Methoden voraus, dass die funktionalen Beobachtungen an einer typischerweise großen Anzahl an Beobachtungspunkten vorliegen, die über alle Kurven gleich sind. Diese starke Anforderung wird in Anwendungen oft nicht erfüllt, da funktionale Beobachtungen häufig an kurvenspezifischen, möglicherweise wenigen, irregulären Gitterpunkten vorliegen. Mit dem Ziel, diese Einschränkung zu überwinden, liegt ein besonderer methodologischer Schwerpunkt dieser Dissertation auf der Erweiterung von funktionalen linearen gemischten Modellen und ihrer Schätzung auf Daten, die auf ungleichen Gittern oder sogar spärlich beobachtet werden.  Diese Dissertation entwickelt ein neues Modellierungsframework, das sowohl komplexe Korrelationsstrukturen zwischen funktionalen Beobachtungen als auch Beobachtungen auf generellen Gittern behandelt. Bisherige Ansätze erlauben entweder weniger allgemeine Korrelationsstrukturen oder lassen keine generellen Gitter und Spärlichkeit der Beobachtungen zu. Dem funktionalen Charakter der Daten wird Rechnung getragen, indem die Modellterme des additiven Prädiktors in geeigneten Basen dargestellt werden. Zur Darstellung der funktionalen zufälligen Effekte werden Basen aus funktionalen Hauptkomponenten gewählt. Diese können als natürliche funktionale Erweiterungen multivariater Hauptkomponenten angesehen werden und repräsentieren somit die Hauptrichtungen der Variation in den Daten. Durch Verwendung der bedeutendsten Richtungen wird eine, für funktionale Daten besonders entscheidende, Dimensionsreduktion erreicht. In Analogie zum multivariaten Fall entsprechen die funktionalen Hauptkomponenten der funktionalen zufälligen Effekte den Eigenfunktionen der entsprechenden Kovarianzoperatoren. Die Schätzung der Kovarianzen latenter Prozesse ist ein nicht triviales Problem und stellt daher ein zentrales Element dieser Dissertation dar. In den ersten beiden Teilen dieser Arbeit werden zwei neue Momentenschätzer für die Kovarianz latenter Prozesse vorgeschlagen. Sie unterscheiden sich in der Allgemeinheit der angenommenen Korrelationsstrukturen und der unterstützten Beobachtungsgitter. Beide Kovarianzschätzmethoden beinhalten bivariate Glättung von einer oder mehreren Kovarianzen. Im dritten Teil wird ein schneller, symmetrischer bivariater Glättungsansatz vorgeschlagen, der besonders geeignet ist um glatte Kovarianzen zu schätzen, indem er sich deren Symmetrieeigenschaften zunutze macht. Seine Anwendung reduziert sowohl Rechenzeit als auch Speicherbedarf erheblich. Das vorgeschlagene Modellierungsframework wird in umfangreichen Simulationsstudien evaluiert. Die Relevanz der vorgeschlagenen Methoden wird durch Analysen von Daten aus der Sprachproduktionsforschung und aus medizinischen Studien hervorgehoben. Um die praktische Verwendung der Methoden zu ermöglichen, werden open-source Implementationen in den beiden R Paketen denseFLMM und sparseFLMM zur Verfügung gestellt.},

Assuming that the function space is a Hilbert space we prove that a Central Limit Theorem (CLT) holds for almost all frequencies θ if the process (Xt) is stationary, ergodic and purely non-deterministic. Under slightly stronger assumptions we formulate versions which provide a CLT for fixed frequencies as well as for Sn(θn), when θn→θ0 is a sequence of fundamental frequencies. In particular we also deduce the regular CLT (θ=0) under new and very mild assumptions. We show that our results apply to the most commonly studied functional time series.},

The size of functional data may vary from terabytes as encountered in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and other applications in brain imaging to just a few kilobytes in longitudinal data with small or modest sample sizes. In this contribution, we highlight some applications of FDA methodology through various data illustrations. We briefly review some basic computational tools that can be used to accelerate implementations of FDA methodology. The analyses presented in this paper illustrate the principal analysis by conditional expectation (PACE) package for FDA, where our applications include both relatively simple and more complex functional data from the biomedical sciences. The data we discuss range from functional data that result from daily movement profile tracking and that are modeled as repeatedly observed functions per subject, to medfly longitudinal behavior profiles, where the goal is to predict remaining lifetime of individual flies. We also discuss the quantification of connectivity of fMRI signals that is of interest in brain imaging and the prediction of continuous traits from high-dimensional SNPs in genomics. The methods of FDA that we demonstrate for these analyses include functional principal component analysis, functional regression and correlation, the modeling of dependent functional data, and the stringing of high-dimensional data into functional data and can be implemented with the PACE package.},

  abstract = {In many human movement studies angle-time series data on several groups of individuals are measured. Current methods to compare groups include comparisons of the mean value in each group or use multivariate techniques such as principal components analysis and perform tests on the principal component scores. Such methods have been useful, though discard a large amount of information. Functional data analysis (FDA) is an emerging statistical analysis technique in human movement research which treats the angle-time series data as a function rather than a series of discrete measurements. This approach retains all of the information in the data. Functional principal components analysis (FPCA) is an extension of multivariate principal components analysis which examines the variability of a sample of curves and has been used to examine differences in movement patterns of several groups of individuals. Currently the functional principal components (FPCs) for each group are either determined separately (yielding components that are group-specific), or by combining the data for all groups and determining the FPCs of the combined data (yielding components that summarize the entire data set). The group-specific FPCs contain both within and between group variation and issues arise when comparing FPCs across groups when the order of the FPCs alter in each group. The FPCs of the combined data may not adequately describe all groups of individuals and comparisons between groups typically use t-tests of the mean FPC scores in each group. When these differences are statistically non-significant it can be difficult to determine how a particular intervention is affecting movement patterns or how injured subjects differ from controls. In this paper we aim to perform FPCA in a manner allowing sensible comparisons between groups of curves. A statistical technique called common functional principal components analysis (CFPCA) is implemented. CFPCA identifies the common sources of variation evident across groups but allows the order of each component to change for a particular group. This allows for the direct comparison of components across groups. We use our method to analyze a biomechanical data set examining the mechanisms of chronic Achilles tendon injury and the functional effects of orthoses.},

This representation is based on a direct Karhunen-Loève expansion of the unobserved derivatives and leads to the notion of derivative principal component analysis, which complements functional principal component analysis, one of the most popular tools of functional data analysis. The proposed derivative principal component scores can be obtained for irregularly spaced and sparsely observed longitudinal data, as typically encountered in biomedical studies, as well as for functional data which are densely measured. Novel consistency results and asymptotic convergence rates for the proposed estimates of the derivative principal component scores and other components of the model are derived under a unified scheme for sparse or dense observations and mild conditions. We compare the proposed representations for derivatives with alternative approaches in simulation settings and also in a wallaby growth curve application. It emerges that representations using the proposed derivative principal component analysis recover the underlying derivatives more accurately compared to principal component analysis-based approaches especially in settings where the functional data are represented with only a very small number of components or are densely sampled. In a second wheat spectra classification example, derivative principal component scores were found to be more predictive for the protein content of wheat than the conventional functional principal component scores.},

This decomposition serves as a visualization tool for the centrality of curves. Furthermore, an outlier detection procedure is proposed based on functional directional outlyingness. This criterion applies to both univariate and multivariate curves and simulation studies show that it outperforms competing methods.

  abstract = {Purpose We aimed to study variations in strength and power performance during the menstrual cycle (MC) in eumenorrheic young women and during the pill cycle in oral contraceptives (OC) users. Methods Forty healthy, normal-weight women between 18 and 35 yr (n = 30 eumenorrheic women; n = 10 OC users) completed this prospective cohort study. Seven to nine times during the MC/pill-cycle, the participants completed a physical performance test series, a questionnaire about psychological well-being, blood sampling, and determination of body mass. The physical tests included isometric handgrip strength, elbow flexor strength, countermovement jump (CMJ) height, and a 10-s Wingate bike test. Results No direct correlation was observed between the variations in sex hormones and physical performance parameters. However, positive correlations were observed between physical performance outcomes and self-reported motivation, perception of own physical performance level, pleasure level, and arousal level. CMJ was 6\% lower in the late luteal phase (LL) compared with the midluteal phase (ML) (P = 0.04). Wingate peak power was 3\% lower in early follicular (EF) compared with the ML (P = 0.04). Furthermore, Wingate average power was 2\%–5\% lower in LL compared with all other MC phases. In line with these observations, physical pain was higher in EF and LL, and the pleasure level was lower in EF compared with the other MC phases. In OC users, we observed no variation in performance and self-reported parameters between the placebo-pill phase and the OC-pill phase. Conclusions Impairments in CMJ and Wingate performance were observed at the end and start of MC compared with other MC phases, which were associated with lower psychological well-being, but not the sex hormone fluctuations.},

  abstract = {Pedaling asymmetry is claimed as a factor of influence on injury and performance. However, the evidence is still controversial. Most previous studies determined peak torque asymmetries, which in our understanding does not consider the pattern of movement like torque profiles. Here we demonstrate that asymmetries in pedaling torque at different exercise intensities can be better described when the torque profiles are considered using functional analysis of variance than when only the peak values are analyzed. We compared peak torques and torque curves recorded while cyclists pedaled at submaximal intensities of 60\%, 80\%, and 95\% of the maximal power output and compared data between the preferred and non-preferred legs. ANOVA showed symmetry or rather no difference in the amount of peak torque between legs, regardless of pedaling intensity. FANOVA, on the other hand, revealed significant asymmetries between legs, regardless of cycling intensity, apparently for different sections of the cycle, however, not for peak torque, either. We conclude that pedaling asymmetry cannot be quantified solely by peak torques and considering the analysis of the entire movement cycle can more accurately reflect the biomechanical movement pattern. Therefore, FANOVA data analysis could be an alternative to identify asymmetries. A novel approach as described here might be useful when combining kinetics assessment with other approaches like EMG and kinematics and help to better understand the role of pedaling asymmetries for performance and injury risks.},

This greatly enhances the interpretability of deep network weights, by elucidating that they are effectively a superposition of the training examples. The network architecture incorporates knowledge of the target function into the kernel. This improved understanding should lead to better learning algorithms.},

  abstract = {It is common practice in deep learning to represent a measurement of the world on a discrete grid, e.g. a 2D grid of pixels. However, the underlying signal represented by these measurements is often continuous, e.g. the scene depicted in an image. A powerful continuous alternative is then to represent these measurements using an implicit neural representation, a neural function trained to output the appropriate measurement value for any input spatial location. In this paper, we take this idea to its next level: what would it take to perform deep learning on these functions instead, treating them as data? In this context we refer to the data as functa, and propose a framework for deep learning on functa. This view presents a number of challenges around efficient conversion from data to functa, compact representation of functa, and effectively solving downstream tasks on functa. We outline a recipe to overcome these challenges and apply it to a wide range of data modalities including images, 3D shapes, neural radiance fields (NeRF) and data on manifolds. We demonstrate that this approach has various compelling properties across data modalities, in particular on the canonical tasks of generative modeling, data imputation, novel view synthesis and classification.},

Bicycles were fitted with SRM powermeters, which recorded power (W), cadence (rpm), distance (km) and speed (km~h−1). Racing data were analysed to establish time in power output and metabolic threshold bands and maximal mean power (MMP) over different durations. When compared to HILLY, FLAT were raced at a similar cadence (75±8 vs. 75±4~rpm, P=0.93) but higher speed (37.6±2.6 vs. 33.9±2.7~km~h−1, P=0.008) and power output (192±21 vs. 169±17~W, P=0.04; 3.3±0.3 vs. 3.0±0.4~W~kg−1, P=0.04). During FLAT races, riders spent significantly more time above 500~W, while greater race time was spent between 100 and 300~W (LT-AT) for HILLY races, with higher MMPs for 180–300~s.

On the other hand, nonparametric statistics produces useful tools for standard data exploration. This book links these two fields of modern statistics by explaining how functional data can be studied through parameter-free statistical ideas. This book starts from theoretical foundations including functional nonparametric modeling, description of the mathematical framework, construction of the statistical methods, and statements of their asymptotic behaviors. It proceeds to computational issues including R and S-PLUS routines. Several functional datasets in chemometrics, econometrics, and pattern recognition are used to emphasize the wide scope of nonparametric functional data analysis in applied sciences. The companion Web site includes R and S-PLUS routines, command lines for reproducing examples presented in the book, and the functional datasets. Rather than set application against theory, this book is really an interface of these two features of statistics. A special effort has been made in writing this book to accommodate several levels of reading. The computational aspects are oriented toward practitioners whereas open problems emerging from this new field of statistics will attract Ph.D. students and academic researchers. Finally, this book is also accessible to graduate students starting in the area of functional statistics. Frédéric Ferraty and Philippe Vieu are both researchers in statistics at Toulouse University (France). They are co-founders and co-organizers of the working group STAPH which acquired an international reputation for functional and operatorial statistics. They are authors of many international publications in nonparametric inference as well as functional data analysis. Their scientific works are based on extensive collaborations both with academic statisticians and with scientists from other areas. They have been invited to organize special sessions on functional data in recent international conferences and to teach Ph.D. courses in various countries.},

There were no significant changes during treadmill running in maximum oxygen uptake (VO2peak; -0.2, -6.0, and +2.7\%), steady state submaximal VO2 at 2.68 m.s-1 (-1.2, -3.3 and +0.2 ml.kg-1.min-1), velocity at VO2peak (+0.05, +0.25 and +0.09 m.s-1) or accumulated O2 deficit (+11.2, -6.1 and +9.4\%) in the R, XT or C groups, respectively. There was a significant increase in velocity associated with a blood lactate concentration of 4 mmol.l-1 in R but not in XT or C (+0.32, +0.07 and +0.08 m.s-1). There were significant changes in arm crank VO2peak (+5\%) and arm crank VO2 at 4 mmol.l-1 (+6.4\%) in XT. There was no significant changes in arm crank VO2peak (+1.3 and -7.7\%) or arm crank VO2 at 4 mmol.l-1 (+0.8 and +0.4\%) in R or C, respectively. The data suggest that muscularly non-similar XT may contribute to improved running performance but not to the same degree as increased specific training.},

  abstract = {The ability to monitor training is critical to the process of quantitating training periodization plans. To date, no method has proven successful in monitoring training during multiple types of exercise. High-intensity exercise training is particularly difficult to quantitate. In this study we evaluate the ability of the session rating of perceived exertion (RPE) method to quantitate training during non-steady state and prolonged exercise compared with an objective standard based on heart rate (HR). In a 2-part design, subjects performed steady state and interval cycle exercise or practiced basketball. Exercise bouts were quantitated using both the session RPE method and an objective HR method. During cycle exercise, the relationship between the exercise score derived using the session RPE method and the HR method was highly consistent, although the absolute score was significantly greater with the session RPE method. During basketball, there was a consistent relationship between the 2 methods of monitoring exercise, although the absolute score was also significantly greater with the session RPE method. Despite using different subjects in the 2 parts of the study, the regression relationships between the session RPE method and the HR method were nearly overlapping, suggesting the broad applicability of this method. We conclude that the session RPE method is a valid method of quantitating exercise training during a wide variety of types of exercise. As such, this technique may hold promise as a mode and intensity-independent method of quantitating exercise training and may provide a tool to allow the quantitative evaluation of training periodization plans.},

Methods:~         Sixteen competitive cyclists (V˙O2peak = 60.3 ± 8.3 mL·kg−1·min−1) completed three laboratory visits using their own bicycles and a power-measuring rear wheel. In visit 1, subjects performed an incremental load test to volitional termination on an electronically braked trainer (100 + 25 W every 4 min). Power output at lactate threshold was determined by absolute 4 mmol·L−1 (OBLA-PO) and 1 mmol·L−1 over exercise baseline (LT-PO). Power output at ventilatory threshold (VT-PO) was computed on the basis of the V-slope method. Power output at V˙O2peak (V˙O2peak-PO) was the mean power observed during the stage at which peak O2 consumption was recorded. In visits 2 and 3, subjects performed the 3MT using a progressive resistance trainer with Visit 2 as a familiarization trial. During Visit 3, EP was recorded.         Results:~         EP (273 ± 52 W) was significantly greater than VT-PO, OBLA-PO, and LT-PO (232 ± 64, 235 ± 54, and 208 ± 45 W, respectively) but significantly less than V˙O2peak-PO (288 ± 56 W). EP was correlated with V˙O2peak-PO (r = 0.97), VT-PO (r = 0.87), OBLA-PO (r = 0.85), and LT-PO (r = 0.79) with regression estimates through the origin made using 105\%, 86\%, 86\%, and 76\% of EP, respectively. Demarcations for moderate- to heavy-intensity (LT-PO at 76\% EP) and heavy- to severe-intensity (100\% EP) domains may be estimated.         Conclusion:~         The 3MT can be used to define exercise intensity in competitive cyclists using readily available equipment.},

Our methods are motivated by a longitudinal brain diffusion tensor imaging tractography study. One of the study’s primary goals is to evaluate the contemporaneous association between human function and brain imaging over time. The complexity of the study requires the development of methods that can simultaneously incorporate: (1) multiple functional (and scalar) regressors; (2) longitudinal outcome and predictor measurements per patient; (3) Gaussian or non-Gaussian outcomes; and (4) missing values within functional predictors. We propose two versions of a new method, longitudinal functional principal components regression (PCR). These methods extend the well-known functional PCR and allow for different effects of subject-specific trends in curves and of visit-specific deviations from that trend. The new methods are compared with existing approaches, and the most promising techniques are used for analyzing the tractography data.},

The reason is that functional data are essentially functions and most algorithms are designed to work with (low) finite-dimensional vectors. Within this context we propose techniques to obtain finitedimensional representations of functional data. The key idea is to consider each functional curve as a point in a general function space and then project these points onto a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space with the aid of Regularization theory. In this work we describe the projection method, analyze its theoretical properties and propose a model selection procedure to select appropriate Reproducing Kernel Hilbert spaces to project the functional data.},

  abstract = {By clustering patients with the urologic chronic pelvic pain syndromes (UCPPS) into homogeneous subgroups and associating these subgroups with baseline covariates and other clinical outcomes, we provide opportunities to investigate different potential elements of pathogenesis, which may also guide us in selection of appropriate therapeutic targets. Motivated by the longitudinal urologic symptom data with extensive subject heterogeneity and differential variability of trajectories, we propose a functional clustering procedure where each subgroup is modeled by a functional mixed effects model, and the posterior probability is used to iteratively classify each subject into different subgroups. The classification takes into account both group-average trajectories and between-subject variabilities. We develop an equivalent state-space model for efficient computation. We also propose a cross-validation based Kullback-Leibler information criterion to choose the optimal number of subgroups. The performance of the proposed method is assessed through a simulation study. We apply our methods to longitudinal bi-weekly measures of a primary urological urinary symptoms score from a UCPPS longitudinal cohort study, and identify four subgroups ranging from moderate decline, mild decline, stable and mild increasing. The resulting clusters are also associated with the one-year changes in several clinically important outcomes, and are also related to several clinically relevant baseline predictors, such as sleep disturbance score, physical quality of life and painful urgency.},

Method: Search engines such as SPORTDiscus, PubMed, and Google Scholar databases in the English language between 2001 and 2016 were consulted for the validity and usefulness of the session-RPE method. Studies were considered for further analysis when they used the session-RPE method proposed by Foster et al. in 2001. Participants were athletes of any gender, age, or level of competition. Studies using languages other than English were excluded in the analysis of the validity and reliability of the session-RPE method. Other studies were examined to explain the rationale of the session-RPE method and the origin of RPE. Results: A total of 950 studies cited the Foster et al. study that proposed the session RPE-method. 36 studies have examined the validity and reliability of this proposed method using the modified CR-10. Conclusion: These studies confirmed the validity and good reliability and internal consistency of session-RPE method in several sports and physical activities with men and women of different age categories (children, adolescents, and adults) among various expertise levels. This method could be used as "standing alone" method for training load (TL) monitoring purposes though some recommend to combine it with other physiological parameters as heart rate.},

Applied functional data analysis (FDA) presents a potentially fruitful but largely unexplored alternative analytics framework that can be incorporated directly into a general Big Data analytics suite. As an example, we present a modeling approach for the dynamics of a functional data set of climatic data. By decomposing functions via a functional principal component analysis and functional variance process analysis, a robust and informative characterization of the data can be derived; this provides insights into the relationship between the different modes of variation, their inherent variance process as well as their dependencies over time. The model is applied to historical data from the Global Historical Climatology Network in California, USA. The analysis reveals that climatic time-dependent information is jointly carried by the original processes as well as their noise/variance decomposition.},

  abstract = {Existing approaches for multivariate functional principal component analysis are restricted to data on the same one-dimensional interval. The presented approach focuses on multivariate functional data on different domains that may differ in dimension, such as functions and images. The theoretical basis for multivariate functional principal component analysis is given in terms of a Karhunen–Loève Theorem. For the practically relevant case of a finite Karhunen–Loève representation, a relationship between univariate and multivariate functional principal component analysis is established. This offers an estimation strategy to calculate multivariate functional principal components and scores based on their univariate counterparts. For the resulting estimators, asymptotic results are derived. The approach can be extended to finite univariate expansions in general, not necessarily orthonormal bases. It is also applicable for sparse functional data or data with measurement error. A flexible R implementation is available on CRAN. The new method is shown to be competitive to existing approaches for data observed on a common one-dimensional domain. The motivating application is a neuroimaging study, where the goal is to explore how longitudinal trajectories of a neuropsychological test score covary with FDG-PET brain scans at baseline. Supplementary material, including detailed proofs, additional simulation results, and software is available online.},

The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It is a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in science or industry. The book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and boosting---the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book. This major new edition features many topics not covered in the original, including graphical models, random forests, ensemble methods, least angle regression and path algorithms for the lasso, non-negative matrix factorization, and spectral clustering. There is also a chapter on methods for ``wide'' data (p bigger than n), including multiple testing and false discovery rates. Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman are professors of statistics at Stanford University. They are prominent researchers in this area: Hastie and Tibshirani developed generalized additive models and wrote a popular book of that title. Hastie co-developed much of the statistical modeling software and environment in R/S-PLUS and invented principal curves and surfaces. Tibshirani proposed the lasso and is co-author of the very successful An Introduction to the Bootstrap. Friedman is the co-inventor of many data-mining tools including CART, MARS, projection pursuit and gradient boosting.},

  abstract = {Objective. The Session Rating of Perceived Extertion (RPE) is a method of measuring exercise intensity that may be useful for the quantitative assessment of exercise training programmes. However, there are inadequate data regarding the validity and reliability of the Session RPE method. This study was designed to evaluate both the validity and reliability of the Session RPE method in comparison to objective measures (\%HRpeak, \%HRreserve and \%VO2peak) of exercise intensity. Methods. Fourteen healthy volunteers (7 male, 7 female) performed 6 randomly ordered 30-minute constant-load exercise bouts at 3 different intensities, with each intensity being repeated. Oxygen consumption (VO2) and heart rate (HR) were measured throughout each exercise bout and normalised to maximal values obtained during a preliminary maximal exercise test. Thirty minutes following the conclusion of each exercise bout, the subject rated the global intensity of the bout using a modification of the Category Ratio (CR) (0 - 10) RPE scale. This rating was compared to the mean value of objectively measured exercise intensity across the duration of the bout. Results. There were significant non-linear relationships between Session RPE and \%VO2peak (R2 = 0.76), \%HRpeak (R2 = 0.74) and \%HRreserve (R2 = 0.71). There were no significant differences between test and retest values of \%VO2peak, \%HRpeak, \%HRreserve and Session RPE during the easy (47 v. 47\%, 65 v. 66\%, 47 v. 48\% and 2.0 v. 1.9), moderate (69 v. 70\%, 83 v. 84\%, 74 v. 75\%, and 4.2 v. 4.3) and hard (81 v. 81\%, 94 v. 94\%, 91 v. 91\% and 7.3 v. 7.4) exercise bouts. Correlations between repeated bouts for \%VO2peak (r = 0.98), \%HRpeak (r = 0.98), \%HRreserve (r = 0.98) and Session RPE (r = 0.88) were significant and strong. Conclusions. The results support the validity and reliability of the Session RPE method of monitoring exercise intensity, although as might be predicted for a subjective method the Session RPE was less precise than the objective measures of exercise training intensity.

  abstract = {A method for generating theoretical breakage distribution functions for multiple particle breakage is presented. It starts with the joint probability function that accounts for all the child particles; it is then reduced to the marginal probability function commonly used in the breakage equation. This method is flexible enough to allow the user to choose the number of child particles and the functional form to be used. The method is demonstrated with both product and summation functions with a power-law form. To facilitate the use of these theoretical functions for statistical analyses, a companion discretized breakage equation is developed. The new equation guarantees the conservation of mass and correct prediction of the total number of particles despite discretization. It is easy to use because it is a set of ordinary differential equations and applicable to both equal-size and geometric-size intervals. Simulation results show that different breakage distribution functions coupled with different breakage rates can produce almost indistinguishable particle-size distributions, signifying the need for further work in this area.},

Such functional time series frequently arise, for example, when a continuous time process is segmented into some smaller natural units, such as days. Then each Xt represents one intraday curve. We argue that functional principal component analysis, though a key technique in the field and a benchmark for any competitor, does not provide an adequate dimension reduction in a time series setting. Functional principal component analysis indeed is a static procedure which ignores the essential information that is provided by the serial dependence structure of the functional data under study. Therefore, inspired by Brillinger's theory of dynamic principal components, we propose a dynamic version of functional principal component analysis which is based on a frequency domain approach. By means of a simulation study and an empirical illustration, we show the considerable improvement that the dynamic approach entails when compared with the usual static procedure.},

Specific inferential problems studied include two sample inference, change point analysis, tests for dependence in data and model residuals and functional prediction. All procedures are described algorithmically, illustrated on simulated and real data sets, and supported by a complete asymptotic theory. The book can be read at two levels. Readers interested primarily in methodology will find detailed descriptions of the methods and examples of their application. Researchers interested also in mathematical foundations will find carefully developed theory. The organization of the chapters makes it easy for the reader to choose an appropriate focus. The book introduces the requisite, and frequently used, Hilbert space formalism in a systematic manner. This will be useful to graduate or advanced undergraduate students seeking a self-contained introduction to the subject. Advanced researchers will find novel asymptotic arguments.},

  abstract = {Economic and financial data often take the form of a collection of curves observed consecutively over time. Examples include, intraday price curves, yield and term structure curves, and intraday volatility curves. Such curves can be viewed as a time series of functions. A fundamental issue that must be addressed, before an attempt is made to statistically model such data, is whether these curves, perhaps suitably transformed, form a stationary functional time series. This paper formalizes the assumption of stationarity in the context of functional time series and proposes several procedures to test the null hypothesis of stationarity. The tests are nontrivial extensions of the broadly used tests in the KPSS family. The properties of the tests under several alternatives, including change-point and I(1), are studied, and new insights, present only in the functional setting are uncovered. The theory is illustrated by a small simulation study and an application to intraday price curves.},

The probabilistic foundation for FDA is described from the perspective of random elements in Hilbert spaces as well as from the viewpoint of continuous time stochastic processes. Nonparametric estimation approaches including kernel and regularized smoothing are also introduced. These tools are then used to investigate the properties of estimators for the mean element, covariance operators, principal components, regression function and canonical correlations. A general treatment of canonical correlations in Hilbert spaces naturally leads to FDA formulations of factor analysis, regression, MANOVA and discriminant analysis.This book will provide a valuable reference for statisticians and other researchers interested in developing or understanding the mathematical aspects of FDA.

We extend one-way functional principal component analysis (PCA) to two-way functional data by introducing regularization of both left and right singular vectors in the singular value decomposition (SVD) of the data matrix. We focus on a penalization approach and solve the nontrivial problem of constructing proper two-way penalties from one-way regression penalties. We introduce conditional cross-validated smoothing parameter selection whereby left-singular vectors are cross-validated conditional on right-singular vectors, and vice versa. The concept can be realized as part of an alternating optimization algorithm. In addition to the penalization approach, we briefly consider two-way regularization with basis expansion. The proposed methods are illustrated with one simulated and two real data examples. Supplemental materials available online show that several “natural” approaches to penalized SVDs are flawed and explain why so.},

It is particularly useful for modeling data in high-dimensional scenarios where the number of variables p is comparable to, or much larger than the sample size n. Despite an extensive literature on this topic, researchers have focused on modeling static principal eigenvectors, which are not suitable for stochastic processes that are dynamic in nature. To characterize the change in the entire course of high-dimensional data collection, we propose a unified framework to directly estimate dynamic eigenvectors of covariance matrices. Specifically, we formulate an optimization problem by combining the local linear smoothing and regularization penalty together with the orthogonality constraint, which can be effectively solved by manifold optimization algorithms. We show that our method is suitable for high-dimensional data observed under both common and irregular designs, and theoretical properties of the estimators are investigated under lq(0≤q≤1) sparsity. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in both simulated and real data examples.},

Such data are ubiquitous in various fields, such as neuroimaging analysis, and cannot be modeled properly by existing methods.

In this class of pathologies, a quick diagnosis is essential for a good prognosis in reperfusive treatment. In particular, an automatic classification procedure based on statistical analysis of teletransmitted electrocardiograph ('ECG') traces would be very helpful for an early diagnosis. This work presents an analysis of ECG traces, either physiological or pathological, of patients whose 12-lead prehospital ECG has been sent to the 118 Dispatch Center in Milan by life-support personnel. The statistical analysis starts with a preprocessing step, where functional data are reconstructed from noisy observations and biological variability is removed by a non-linear registration procedure. Then, a multivariate functional k-means clustering procedure is carried out on reconstructed and registered ECGs and their first derivatives. Hence, a new semi-automatic diagnostic procedure, based solely on the ECG morphology, is proposed to classify ECG traces; finally, the performance of this classification method is evaluated.},

  abstract = {We propose a practical principal component analysis (PCA) framework that provides a nonparametric means of simultaneously reducing the dimensions of and modeling functional and vector (multivariate) data. We first introduce a Hilbert space that combines functional and vector objects as a single hybrid object. The framework, termed a PCA of hybrid functional and vector data (HFV-PCA), is then based on the eigen-decomposition of a covariance operator that captures simultaneous variations of functional and vector data in the new space. This approach leads to interpretable principal components that have the same structure as each observation and a single set of scores that serves well as a low-dimensional proxy for hybrid functional and vector data. To support practical application of HFV-PCA, the explicit relationship between the hybrid PC decomposition and the functional and vector PC decompositions is established, leading to a simple and robust estimation scheme where components of HFV-PCA are calculated using the components estimated from the existing functional and classical PCA methods. This estimation strategy allows flexible incorporation of sparse and irregular functional data as well as multivariate functional data. We derive the consistency results and asymptotic convergence rates for the proposed estimators. We demonstrate the efficacy of the method through simulations and analysis of renal imaging data.},

Existing methods for predicting a complete future functional observation use only completely observed trajectories. We develop a new method, called partial functional prediction (PFP), which uses both completely observed trajectories and partial information (available partial data) on the trajectory to be predicted. The PFP method includes an automatic selection criterion for tuning parameters based on minimizing the prediction error, and the convergence rate of the PFP prediction is established. Simulation studies demonstrate that incorporating partially observed trajectory in the prediction outperforms existing methods with respect to mean squared prediction error. The PFP method is illustrated to be superior in the analysis of environmental data and traffic flow data.},

The second edition updates and substantially expands the original version, and is once again the definitive text on the subject. It includes core material, current research and a wide range of applications. Its length is nearly double that of the first edition. Researchers in statistics, or in other fields that use principal component analysis, will find that the book gives an authoritative yet accessible account of the subject. It is also a valuable resource for graduate courses in multivariate analysis. The book requires some knowledge of matrix algebra.

Principal component analysis (PCA) is a technique for reducing the dimensionality of such datasets, increasing interpretability but at the same time minimizing information loss. It does so by creating new uncorrelated variables that successively maximize variance. Finding such new variables, the principal components, reduces to solving an eigenvalue/eigenvector problem, and the new variables are defined by the dataset at hand, not a priori, hence making PCA an adaptive data analysis technique. It is adaptive in another sense too, since variants of the technique have been developed that are tailored to various different data types and structures. This article will begin by introducing the basic ideas of PCA, discussing what it can and cannot do. It will then describe some variants of PCA and their application.},

  abstract = {Summary. Models based on the bivariate Poisson distribution are used for modelling sports data. Independent Poisson distributions are usually adopted to model the number of goals of two competing teams. We replace the independence assumption by considering a bivariate Poisson model and its extensions. The models proposed allow for correlation between the two scores, which is a plausible assumption in sports with two opposing teams competing against each other. The effect of introducing even slight correlation is discussed. Using just a bivariate Poisson distribution can improve model fit and prediction of the number of draws in football games. The model is extended by considering an inflation factor for diagonal terms in the bivariate joint distribution. This inflation improves in precision the estimation of draws and, at the same time, allows for overdispersed, relative to the simple Poisson distribution, marginal distributions. The properties of the models proposed as well as interpretation and estimation procedures are provided. An illustration of the models is presented by using data sets from football and water-polo.},

Most of the existing literature deals with modelling the number of goals scored by each team. In this paper, we work in a different direction. Instead of modelling the number of goals directly, we focus on the difference of the number of goals, i.e. the margin of victory. Modelling the differences instead of the scores themselves has some major advantages. Firstly, we eliminate correlation imposed by the fact that the two opponent teams compete each other, and secondly, we do not assume that the scored goals by each team are marginally Poisson distributed. Application of the Bayesian methodology for the Skellam's distribution using covariates is discussed. Illustrations using real data from the English Premiership for the season 2006–2007 are provided. The advantages of the proposed approach are also discussed.},

The model is accompanied by data obtained from 74 experiments at different process settings which is used to estimate the model parameters. The experimentally measured quantities are the 10th, 50th and 90th quantiles of the resulting particle size distributions. Parameter estimation is performed on a population balance jet-milling model composed of three subprocesses: jet expansion, milling and classification. The model contains eight parameters requiring estimation and can compute the same quantities that are determined in the experiments. As the model is computationally expensive to solve, the sampling algorithms are applied to a surrogate model to establish algorithm specific parameters and to obtain model parameter estimates. The resulting parameter estimates are given with a discussion of their reliability and the observed behaviour of the two sampling algorithms. Comparison of the autocorrelation function between samples generated by the two algorithms shows that the Wang–Landau algorithm exhibits more rapid decay. Trace plots of the parameter samples from the two algorithms appear to be analogous and encourage the supposition that the Markov Chains have converged to the distribution of interest. One- and two-dimensional density plots indicate a unimodal distribution for all parameters, which suggests that the obtained estimates are unique. The two-dimensional density plots also suggest correlation between at least two of the model parameters. The realised distribution generated by both algorithms produced consistent results and demonstrated similar behaviour. For the application considered in this work, the Wang–Landau algorithm is found to exhibit superior performance with respect to the correlation and equivalent performance in all other respects.},

  abstract = {The multivariate pluriformity and complexity of economic-geographic space (e.g., cities or countries) are reflected in their empirical multidimensional data structure with space–time characteristics. The need to reduce the multiple dimensions of an observation space is present in all social (and other) sciences seeking to identify basic patterns or key relations among critical indicators that characterize economic or social features of the phenomena concerned. For this purpose, multivariate statistics has developed an impressive toolbox, in which traditionally a prominent place is taken by the class of principal component analyses (PCA). This technique dates back to the beginning of the last century and is widely employed in empirical research aiming at reducing complexity in observation spaces toward manageable patterns of a smaller dimensionality. In the present study, we develop and present a new methodological contribution to in the PCA field, by shifting from conventional discrete static data to time-series data approximated by a continuous intertemporal curve reflecting the evolution of the socioeconomic data concerned. In this paper, the statistical foundation of this new approach, called multivariate functional principal component analysis (MFPCA), will be outlined and tested for a multivariate long-range data set on statistical indicators for several countries. The practical validity of the MFPCA method will be demonstrated by means of an application to the evolution of socioeconomic competitiveness (in this paper, we use the WEF definition of competitiveness, which is: “Competitiveness is the set of institutions, policies, and factors that determine the level of productivity of a country” WEF 2015) in different countries of the world, based on official World Economic Forum (WEF) data spanning the period 2008–2015. Our analysis brings to light interesting findings and differences compared to the initial, officially published WEF information.},

The model performance was evaluated in terms of model order (complexity), number of inputs and parameter estimation methods used (time-invariant vs. time-variant). Thirteen male cyclists performed two identical cycling tests of 27 km on the road. Uphill sections were introduced to induce dynamic variations in heart rate. The heart rate and training intensity, represented by power output and road inclination, were measured in real-time. Taking only power as system input allowed to explain the variations in heart rate in an accurate way , since adding the road inclination as an additional input did not significantly improve the modelling performance . Furthermore, we demonstrated that models with first-order dynamics accurately describes the heart rate responses to power variations , but that more complex second-order model structures were significantly better than the first-order model structures (P=0.028). Finally, the heart rate dynamics appeared to be time-variant, since the time-variant model structures were significantly better than the time-invariant model structures . So, compact time-variant second-order model structures could be used to model the heart rate response to training intensity as a basis for training optimisation.},

A novel frequency domain bootstrap method is introduced, which leads to a more accurate approximation of the distribution of the test statistic under the null than the large sample Gaussian approximation derived. Under quite general conditions, asymptotic validity of the bootstrap procedure is established for estimating the distribution of the test statistic under the null. Furthermore, consistency of the bootstrap-based test under the alternative is proved. Numerical simulations show that, even for small samples, the bootstrap-based test has a very good size and power behavior.

  abstract = {Quantifying uncertainty using confidence regions is a central goal of statistical inference. Despite this, methodologies for confidence bands in Functional Data Analysis are still underdeveloped compared to estimation and hypothesis testing. In this work, we present a new methodology for constructing simultaneous confidence bands for functional parameter estimates. Our bands possess a number of striking qualities: (1) they have a nearly closed-form expression and thus are fast to compute, (2) they can be constructed adaptively according to a desired criterion, where we focus on the fairness constraint of false positive rate balance across partitions of the bands' domain which facilitates both global and local interpretations, and (3) they do not require an estimate of the full covariance function and thus can be used in the case of fragmentary functional data. Simulations show the excellent finite-sample behavior of our bands in comparison to existing alternatives. The practical use of our bands is demonstrated in two case studies on sports biomechanics and fragmentary growth curves.},

  abstract = {Functional data clustering analysis becomes an urgent and challenging task in the new era of big data. In this paper, we propose a new framework for functional data clustering analysis, which adopts a similar structure as the k-means algorithm for the conventional clustering analysis. Under this framework, we clarify three issues: how to represent functions, how to measure distances between functions, and how to calculate centers of functions. We utilize Gaussian processes to represent the clusters of functions which are actually their sample curves or trajectories on a finite set of sample points. Moreover, we take the Wasserstein distance to measure the similarity between Gaussian distributions. With the choice of Wasserstein distance, the centers of Gaussian processes can be calculated analytically and efficiently. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we compare it with existing competitive clustering methods on synthetic datasets and the obtained results are encouraging. We finally apply the proposed method to three real-world datasets with satisfying results.},

  abstract = {Mixed-effect models are flexible tools for researchers in a myriad of medical fields, but that flexibility comes at the cost of complexity and if users are not careful in how their model is specified, they could be making faulty inferences from their data. We argue that there is significant confusion around appropriate random effects to be included in a model given the study design, with researchers generally being better at specifying the fixed effects of a model which map onto to their research hypotheses. To that end, we present an instructive framework for evaluating the random effects of a model in three different situations: (1) longitudinal designs; (2) factorial repeated measures; and (3) when dealing with multiple sources of variance. We provide worked examples with open-access code and data in an online repository. This framework will be helpful for students and researchers who are new to mixed effect models, and to reviewers who may have to evaluate a novel model as part of their review.},

  abstract = {In order to quantitatively predict nano- as well as other particle-size distributions, one needs to have both a mathematical model and estimates of the parameters that appear in these models. Here, we show how one can use Bayesian inversion to obtain statistical estimates for the parameters that appear in recently derived mechanism-enabled population balance models (ME-PBM) of nanoparticle growth. The Bayesian approach addresses the question of “how well do we know our parameters, along with their uncertainties?.” The results reveal that Bayesian inversion statistical analysis on an example, prototype nanoparticle formation system allows one to estimate not just the most likely rate constants and other parameter values, but also their SDs, confidence intervals, and other statistical information. Moreover, knowing the reliability of the mechanistic model's parameters in turn helps inform one about the reliability of the proposed mechanism, as well as the reliability of its predictions. The paper can also be seen as a tutorial with the additional goal of achieving a “Gold Standard” Bayesian inversion ME-PBM benchmark that others can use as a control to check their own use of this methodology for other systems of interest throughout nature. Overall, the results provide strong support for the hypothesis that there is substantial value in using a Bayesian inversion methodology for parameter estimation in particle formation systems.},

  abstract = {Professional road cycling is an extreme endurance sport. Approximately 30 000 to 35 000km are cycled each year in training and competition and some races, such as the Tour de France last 21 days (∼100 hours of competition) during which professional cyclists (PC) must cover {$>$}3500km. In some phases of such a demanding sport, on the other hand, exercise intensity is surprisingly high, since PC must complete prolonged periods of exercise (i.e. time trials, high mountain ascents) at high percentages (∼90\%) of maximal oxygen uptake (V̇O2max) [above the anaerobic threshold (AT)]. Although numerous studies have analysed the physiological responses of elite, amateur level road cyclists during the last 2 decades, their findings might not be directly extrapolated to professional cycling. Several studies have recently shown that PC exhibit some remarkable physiological responses and adaptations such as: an efficient respiratory system (i.e. lack of ‘tachypnoeic shift’ at high exercise intensities); a considerable reliance on fat metabolism even at high power outputs; or several neuromuscular adaptations (i.e. a great resistance to fatigue of slow motor units). This article extensively reviews the different responses and adaptations (cardiopulmonary system, metabolism, neuromuscular factors or endocrine system) to this sport. A special emphasis is placed on the evaluation of performance both in the laboratory (i.e. the controversial Conconi test, distinction between climbing and time trial ability, etc.) and during actual competitions such as the Tour de France.},

  abstract = {Cluster analysis of functional data considers that the objects on which you want to perform a taxonomy are functions f:X⊂Rp↦R and the available information about each object is a sample in a finite set of points fn=\{(xi,yi)∈X×R\}i=1n. The aim is to infer the meaningful groups by working explicitly with its infinite-dimensional nature. In this paper the use of K-means algorithms to solve this problem is analysed. A comparative study of three K-means algorithms has been conducted. The K-means algorithm for raw data, a kernel K-means algorithm for raw data and a K-means algorithm using two distances for functional data are tested. These distances, called dVn and dϕ, are based on projections onto Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS) and Tikhonov regularization theory. Although it is shown that both distances are equivalent, they lead to two different strategies to reduce the dimensionality of the data. In the case of dVn distance the most suitable strategy is Johnson–Lindenstrauss random projections. The dimensionality reduction for dϕ is based on spectral methods. A key aspect that has been analysed is the effect of the sampling \{xi\}i=1n on the K-means algorithm performance. In the numerical study an ex professo example is given to show that if the sampling is not uniform in X, then a K-means algorithm that ignores the functional nature of the data can reduce its performance. It is numerically shown that the original K-means algorithm and that suggested here lead to similar performance in the examples when X is uniformly sampled, but the computational cost when working with the original set of observations is higher than the K-means algorithms based on dϕ or dVn, as they use strategies to reduce the dimensionality of the data. The numerical tests are completed with a case study to analyse what kind of problem the K-means algorithm for functional data must face.},

  abstract = {Computational fluid dynamics simulations in practical industrial/environmental cases often involve non-homogeneous concentrations of particles. In Euler–Lagrange simulations, this can induce the propagation of numerical error when the number of collision/agglomeration events is computed using mean-field approaches. In fact, mean-field statistical collision models allow to sample the number of collision events using a priori information on the frequency of collisions (the collision kernel). Yet, since such methods often rely on the mesh used for the Eulerian simulation of the fluid phase, the particle number concentration within a given cell might not be homogeneous, leading to numerical errors. In this article, we apply the data-driven spatial decomposition (D2SD) algorithm to control such error in simulations of particle agglomeration. Significant improvements are made to design a fast D2SD version, minimising the additional computational cost by developing re-meshing criteria. Through the application to some practical simulation cases, we show the importance of splitting the domain when computing agglomeration events in Euler/Lagrange simulations, so that within each elementary cell there is a spatially uniform distribution of particles.},

In this review, cyclists are referred to as either internationally competitive (International Cycling Union world rankings provided when available) or nationally competitive. Based on the limited data available it appears that the age, height, body mass (BM) and body composition of women cyclists who have been selected to the US and Australian National Road Cycling Teams from 1980 to 2000 are fairly similar. Female cyclists who have become internationally competitive are generally between 21 to 28 years of age, 162 to 174cm, 55.4 to 58.8kg and 38 to 51mm (sum of 7 skinfolds) corresponding to 7 to 12\% body fat. The lower BM and percentage body fat are traits unique to the most competitive women. Internationally competitive women cyclists also possess a slightly superior ability to produce a high absolute power output for a fixed time period and a noticeably greater ability to produce power output relative to BM. In Women’s World Cup races, successful women (top 20 places) spend more time {$<$}7.5W/kg (11 ± 2 vs 7 ± 2\%, p {$<$} 0.01) and less time {$<$}0.75 W/kg (24 ± 4 vs 29 ± 3\%, p = 0.05) compared with non-top 20 placed riders. Additionally, cyclists in the top 20 produced higher average power (3.6 ± 0.4 vs 3.1 ± 0.1 W/kg, p = 0.01). Unlike professional men’s road cycling, the physiological characteristics of internationally competitive female road cyclists and the demands of women’s cycling competition are poorly understood.},

In cycling, the advent of power meters led to new indexes, such as TSS. All these indexes have limitations, especially for high intensity exercise. Therefore, a new index for cycling is proposed, the Power Profile Index (PPi), which includes a weighting factor obtained from the relative exercise intensity and stage type. Using power data from 67 WorldTour cyclists and fatigue records in different stage types from 102 road cyclists, weighting factors for intensity and stage type were determined. Subsequently, the PPi was computed and compared to current indexes using data from a WorldTour team during the 2018 Tour de France. The proposed index showed a strong correlation with perceived fatigue as a function of stage type (R2 = 0.9996), as well as no differences in the load quantification in different types of stage profiles (p = 0.292), something that does not occur with other indexes such as TSS, RPE, or eTRIMP (p {$<$} 0.001). Therefore, PPi is a new index capable of quantifying the high intensity efforts that produce greater fatigue, as well as considering the stage type.},

METHODS: Power output data (32,028 files containing both training and competition sessions recorded) in 44 female professional cyclists during 1-6 years were analyzed. Cyclists were categorized as all-rounders, time trialists, climbers, or sprinters. The record power profile was calculated using the mean maximal power output (MMP) values attained by each cyclist for different-effort durations (5~s to 60~min) expressed in relative (W·kg-1), as well as absolute, power output (W). RESULTS: Participants' MMP averaged 15.3 (1.8)~W·kg-1 for 5 seconds, 8.4 (0.8)~W·kg-1 for 1 minute, 5.2 (0.5)~W·kg-1 for 10 minutes, and 4.2 (0.4)~W·kg-1 for 60 minutes. For short-duration efforts (5-30~s), sprinters attained the highest MMP results, with significantly higher relative (Hedges g = 1.40-2.31) or absolute (g = 4.48-8.06) values than the remainder of categories or climbers only, respectively. Time trialists attained the highest MMP for longer efforts, with higher relative values than both all-rounders and climbers when comparing efforts lasting 10 to 60 minutes (P {$<$} .05, g = 1.21-1.54). CONCLUSIONS: In professional female cyclists, the record power profile substantially differs based on the specific category of the rider. These findings provide unique insights into the physical capacities of female professional cyclists, as well as a benchmark for coaches and scientists aiming to identify talent in female cycling.},

It covers from the basics of regression to multilevel models. The author also discusses measurement error, missing data, and Gaussian process models for spatial and network autocorrelation. By using complete R code examples throughout, this book provides a practical foundation for performing statistical inference. Designed for both PhD students and seasoned professionals in the natural and social sciences, it prepares them for more advanced or specialized statistical modeling. Web Resource The book is accompanied by an R package (rethinking) that is available on the author's website and GitHub. The two core functions (map and map2stan) of this package allow a variety of statistical models to be constructed from standard model formulas},

  abstract = {The data revolution has led to an increased interest in the practice of data analysis. While much has been written about statistical thinking, a complementary form of thinking that appears in the practice of data analysis is design thinking—the problem-solving process to understand the people for whom a solution is being designed. For a given problem, there can be significant or subtle differences in how a data analyst (or producer of a data analysis) constructs, creates, or designs a data analysis, including differences in the choice of methods, tooling, and workflow. These choices can affect the data analysis products themselves and the experience of the consumer of the data analysis. Therefore, the role of a producer can be thought of as designing the data analysis with a set of design principles. Here, we introduce design principles for data analysis and describe how they can be mapped to data analyses in a quantitative and informative manner. We also provide data showing variation of principles within and between producers of data analyses. Our work suggests a formal mechanism to describe data analyses based on design principles. These results provide guidance for future work in characterizing the data analytic process. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

  abstract = {Background: In elite athletes, training individualization is widely recommended to optimize competitive performance. Previous studies have evidenced the impact of hormonal fluctuations on different performance parameters among female athletes. While consideration of menstrual cycle (MC) phases as a parameter in training individualization strategies is necessary, systematic evidence identifying such impacts in elite athletes should be evaluated.Objective: Systematically review publications that have investigated the link between MC phases and performance in elite female athletes. The overarching aim is to identify whether a consensus across studies exists enabling evidence-based recommendations for training individualization depending on menstrual cycle phases.Methods: This review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Three major scientific publication databases were searched from inception until November 3, 2020. Studies included focused on the influence of physiological or psychological parameters throughout at least one phase of the menstrual cycle of elite athletes.Results: A total of 780 search results were yielded and 26 references from a past bibliography were added manually. About 662 papers were reviewed of which 218 studies were assessed for eligibility. Of these, only seven (1\%) precisely investigated the influence of a performance or physical parameter during at least one menstrual cycle phase. These seven studies included a total of 314 elite female participants (20.58 ± 1.91 years). Three used interviews, questionnaires or prospective analyses of reports. Four conducted several performance tests or included physical measures although only two performed tests during training or before/during competition. Among the seven studies, five performed hormonal testing through sampling of blood, saliva, or urine. The remaining relied on athletes’ menstruation diaries. The current evidence suggests a variable association between menstrual cycle and a few performance-related outcomes, such as endurance or power resistance, ligament stiffness, decision making skills, psychology, or competitiveness.Conclusion: Different sports performance-related parameters are affected during the menstrual cycle among elite athletes, but the parameters themselves and the magnitude and the direction of the effects are inconclusive. Additional longitudinal and prospective studies to systematically monitor on-field performance parameters are urgently required in order to enable recommendations and training individualization in female elite athletes.},

Methods: Race data were collected in 1-d World Cup races during the 2012–2015 road cycling seasons. Seven female cyclists completed 49 WC races, finishing 25 times in T10 and 24 times in N-T10. Peak power (1 s) and maximal mean power (MMP) for durations of 5, 10, 20, and 30 s and 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 30, and 60 min expressed as power to weight ratio were analyzed in T10 and N-T10. The percentage of total race time spent at different power bands was compared between T10 and N-T10 using 0.75-W·kg−1 power bands, ranging from {$<$}0.75 to {$>$}7.50 W·kg−1. The number of efforts in which the power output remained above 7.50 W·kg−1 for at least 10 s was recorded. Results: MMPs were significantly higher in T10 than in N-T10, with a large effect size for durations between 10 s and 5 min. N-T10 spent more time in the 3.01- to 3.75-W·kg−1 power band when compared to T10 (P\,=\,.011); conversely, T10 spent more time in the 6.75- to 7.50- and {$>$}7.50-W·kg−1 power bands (P\,=\,.009 and .005, respectively) than N-T10. A significantly higher number of short and high-intensity efforts (≥10 s, {$>$}7.5 W·kg−1) was ridden by T10 than N-T10 (P\,=\,.002), specifically, 46\,±\,20 and 30\,±\,15 efforts for T10 and N-T10, respectively. Conclusions: The ability to ride at high intensity was determinant for successful road-cycling performances in WC races.},

In the model, a systematically quantified impulse of training produces dual responses: fitness and fatigue. In the absence of training, both decay exponentially with time. With repetitive training, these responses satisfy individual recurrence equations. Fitness and fatigue are combined in a simple linear difference equation to predict performance levels appropriate to the intensity of training being undertaken. Significant observed correlation of model-predicted performance with a measure of actual performance during both training and tapering provides validation of the model for athletes and nonathletes alike. This enables specific model parameters to be estimated and can be used to optimize future training regimens for any individual.},

Due to the wide range of mechanisms present, several models are presented in the literature since several hypotheses are considered. In the current work, the Approximate Bayesian Computational statistical technique was used to select four different models of population balance and estimate their parameters. Three strategies were applied to the drawing of parameters, evaluating the correlation between the parameters of the models. An adaptive tolerance in each population and a stopping criterion, based on Morozov's uncertainty principle, were used for the algorithm. The technique obtained reasonable estimates for the phenomenological rates of the models. The algorithm correctly selected the model used for generating measurements, and the three draw strategies demonstrated good applicability. The results obtained showed that the algorithm presented accuracy and precision in estimating the parameters and properly selected the models analyzed.},

  abstract = {The female hormones, oestrogen and progesterone, fluctuate predictably across the menstrual cycle in naturally cycling eumenorrhoeic women. Other than reproductive function, these hormones influence many other physiological systems, and their action during exercise may have implications for exercise performance. Although a number of studies have found exercise performance — and in particular, endurance performance — to vary between menstrual phases, there is an equal number of such studies reporting no differences. However, a comparison of the increase in the oestrogen concentration (E) relative to progesterone concentration (P) as the E/P ratio (pmol/ nmol) in the luteal phase in these studies reveals that endurance performance may only be improved in the mid-luteal phase compared with the early follicular phase when the E/P ratio is high in the mid-luteal phase. Furthermore, the late follicular phase, characterized by the pre-ovulatory surge in oestrogen and suppressed progesterone concentrations, tends to promote improved performance in a cycling time trial and future studies should include this menstrual phase. Menstrual phase variations in endurance performance may largely be a consequence of changes to exercise metabolism stimulated by the fluctuations in ovarian hormone concentrations. The literature suggests that oestrogen may promote endurance performance by altering carbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism, with progesterone often appearing to act antagonistically. Details of the ovarian hormone influences on the metabolism of these macronutrients are no longer only limited to evidence from animal research and indirect calorimetry but have been verified by substrate kinetics determined with stable tracer methodology in eumenorrhoeic women. This review thoroughly examines the metabolic perturbations induced by the ovarian hormones and, by detailed comparison, proposes reasons for many of the inconsistent reports in menstrual phase comparative research. Often the magnitude of increase in the ovarian hormones between menstrual phases and the E/P ratio appear to be important factors determining an effect on metabolism. However, energy demand and nutritional status may be confounding variables, particularly in carbohydrate metabolism. The review specifically considers how changes in metabolic responses due to the ovarian hormones may influence exercise performance. For example, oestrogen promotes glucose availability and uptake into type I muscle fibres providing the fuel of choice during short duration exercise; an action that can be inhibited by progesterone. A high oestrogen concentration in the luteal phase augments muscle glycogen storage capacity compared with the low oestrogen environment of the early follicular phase. However, following a carbo-loading diet will super-compensate muscle glycogen stores in the early follicular phase to values attained in the luteal phase. Oestrogen concentrations of the luteal phase reduce reliance on muscle glycogen during exercise and although not as yet supported by human tracer studies, oestrogen increases free fatty acid availability and oxidative capacity in exercise, favouring endurance performance. Evidence of oestrogen’s stimulation of 50-AMPactivated protein kinase may explain many of the metabolic actions of oestrogen. However, both oestrogen and progesterone suppress gluconeogenic output during exercise and this may compromise performance in the latter stages of ultra-long events if energy replacement supplements are inadequate. Moreover, supplementing energy intake during exercise with protein may be more relevant when progesterone concentration is elevated compared with menstrual phases favouring a higher relative oestrogen concentration, as progesterone promotes protein catabolism while oestrogen suppresses protein catabolism. Furthermore, prospective research ideas for furthering the understanding of the impact of the menstrual cycle on metabolism and exercise performance are highlighted.},

The key element in such a context is the spectral density operator, which generalises the notion of a spectral density matrix to the functional setting, and characterises the second-order dynamics of the process. Our main tool is the functional Discrete Fourier Transform (fDFT). We derive an asymptotic Gaussian representation of the fDFT, thus allowing the transformation of the original collection of dependent random functions into a collection of approximately independent complex-valued Gaussian random functions. Our results are then employed in order to construct estimators of the spectral density operator based on smoothed versions of the periodogram kernel, the functional generalisation of the periodogram matrix. The consistency and asymptotic law of these estimators are studied in detail. As immediate consequences, we obtain central limit theorems for the mean and the long-run covariance operator of a stationary functional time series. Our results do not depend on structural modelling assumptions, but only functional versions of classical cumulant mixing conditions, and are shown to be stable under discrete observation of the individual curves.},

  abstract = {Mobile power meters provide a valid means of measuring cyclists’ power output in the field. These field measurements can be performed with very good accuracy and reliability making the power meter a useful tool for monitoring and evaluating training and race demands. This review presents power meter data from a Grand Tour cyclist’s training and racing and explores the inherent complications created by its stochastic nature. Simple summary methods cannot reflect a session’s variable distribution of power output or indicate its likely metabolic stress. Binning power output data, into training zones for example, provides information on the detail but not the length of efforts within a session. An alternative approach is to track changes in cyclists’ modelled training and racing performances. Both critical power and record power profiles have been used for monitoring training-induced changes in this manner. Due to the inadequacy of current methods, the review highlights the need for new methods to be established which quantify the effects of training loads and models their implications for performance.},

  abstract = {The recent sports science literature conveys a growing interest in robust statistical methods to analyze smooth, regularly-sampled functional data. This paper focuses on the inferential problem of identifying the parts of a functional domain where two population means differ. We considered four approaches recently used in sports science: interval-wise testing (IWT), statistical parametric mapping (SPM), statistical nonparametric mapping (SnPM) and the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure for false discovery control. We applied these procedures to both six representative sports science datasets, and also to systematically varied simulated datasets which replicated ten signal- and/or noise-relevant parameters that were identified in the experimental datasets. We observed generally higher IWT and BH sensitivity for five of the six experimental datasets. BH was the most sensitive procedure in simulation, but also had relatively high false positive rates (generally {$>$} 0.1) which increased sharply ({$>$} 0.3) in certain extreme simulation scenarios including highly rough data. SPM and SnPM were more sensitive than IWT in simulation except for (1) high roughness, (2) high nonstationarity, and (3) highly nonuniform smoothness. These results suggest that the optimum procedure is both signal and noise-dependent. We conclude that: (1) BH is most sensitive but also susceptible to high false positive rates, (2) IWT, SPM and SnPM appear to have relatively inconsequential differences in terms of domain identification sensitivity, except in cases of extreme signal/noise characteristics, where IWT appears to be superior at identifying a greater portion of the true signal.},

  abstract = {When investigating the dynamics of three-dimensional multi-body biomechanical systems it is often difficult to derive spatiotemporally directed predictions regarding experimentally induced effects. A paradigm of 'non-directed' hypothesis testing has emerged in the literature as a result. Non-directed analyses typically consist of ad hoc scalar extraction, an approach which substantially simplifies the original, highly multivariate datasets (many time points, many vector components). This paper describes a commensurately multivariate method as an alternative to scalar extraction. The method, called 'statistical parametric mapping' (SPM), uses random field theory to objectively identify field regions which co-vary significantly with the experimental design. We compared SPM to scalar extraction by re-analyzing three publicly available datasets: 3D knee kinematics, a ten-muscle force system, and 3D ground reaction forces. Scalar extraction was found to bias the analyses of all three datasets by failing to consider sufficient portions of the dataset, and/or by failing to consider covariance amongst vector components. SPM overcame both problems by conducting hypothesis testing at the (massively multivariate) vector trajectory level, with random field corrections simultaneously accounting for temporal correlation and vector covariance. While SPM has been widely demonstrated to be effective for analyzing 3D scalar fields, the current results are the first to demonstrate its effectiveness for 1D vector field analysis. It was concluded that SPM offers a generalized, statistically comprehensive solution to scalar extraction's over-simplification of vector trajectories, thereby making it useful for objectively guiding analyses of complex biomechanical systems.},

It has been shown that 1D confidence intervals (CIs) are biased when based on 0D statistical procedures, and the non-parametric 1D bootstrap CI has emerged in the Biomechanics literature as a viable solution. The primary purpose of this paper was to clarify that, for 1D biomechanics datasets, the distinction between 0D and 1D methods is much more important than the distinction between parametric and non-parametric procedures. A secondary purpose was to demonstrate that a parametric equivalent to the 1D bootstrap exists in the form of a random field theory (RFT) correction for multiple comparisons. To emphasize these points we analyzed six datasets consisting of force and kinematic trajectories in one-sample, paired, two-sample and regression designs. Results showed, first, that the 1D bootstrap and other 1D non-parametric CIs were qualitatively identical to RFT CIs, and all were very different from 0D CIs. Second, 1D parametric and 1D non-parametric hypothesis testing results were qualitatively identical for all six datasets. Last, we highlight the limitations of 1D CIs by demonstrating that they are complex, design-dependent, and thus non-generalizable. These results suggest that (i) analyses of 1D data based on 0D models of randomness are generally biased unless one explicitly identifies 0D variables before the experiment, and (ii) parametric and non-parametric 1D hypothesis testing provide an unambiguous framework for analysis when one׳s hypothesis explicitly or implicitly pertains to whole 1D trajectories.},

These algorithms are based on systems of weighted computational particles and the weight transfer functions are constructed such that the number of computational particles does not change during coagulation events. The algorithms also facilitate the simulation of physical processes that change single particles, such as growth, or other surface reactions. Four members of the algorithm family have been numerically validated by comparison to analytic solutions to simple problems. Numerical experiments have been performed for complex laminar premixed flame systems in which members of the class of stochastic weighted particle methods were compared to each other and to a direct simulation algorithm. Two of the weighted algorithms have been shown to offer performance advantages over the direct simulation algorithm in situations where interest is focused on the larger particles in a system. The extent of this advantage depends on the particular system and on the quantities of interest.},

  abstract = {Purpose: To examine the power-output distribution and sprint characteristics of professional female road cyclists. Methods: A total of 31 race files, representing top 5 finishes, were collected from 7 professional female cyclists. Files were analyzed for sprint characteristics, including mean and peak power output, velocity, and duration. The final 20 min before the sprint was analyzed to determine the mean maximal power output (MMP) consistent with durations of 5, 15, 30, 60, 240, and 600 s. Throughout the race, the number of efforts for each duration exceeding 80\% of its corresponding final 20-min MMP (MMP80) was determined. The number of 15-s efforts exceeding 80\% of the mean final sprint power output (MSP80) was determined. Results: Sprint finishes lasted 21.8 (6.7) s with mean and peak power outputs of 679 (101) and 886 (91) W, respectively. Throughout the race, additional 5-, 15-, and 30-s efforts above MMP80 were completed in the 5th compared with the 1st–4th quintiles of the race. The 60-s efforts were greater during the 5th quintile compared with the 1st, 2nd, and 4th quintiles, and during the 3rd compared with the 4th quintile. More 240-s efforts were recorded during the 5th compared with the 1st and 4th quintiles. About 82\% of the 15-s efforts above MSP80 were completed in the 2nd, 3rd, and 5th quintiles of the race. Conclusions: These data demonstrate the variable nature of women’s professional cycling and the physical demands necessary for success, thus providing information that could enhance in-race decision making and the development of race-specific training programs.},

An unadjusted p-value function and an adjusted one are the output of the procedure, namely interval-wise testing. Depending on the sort and level α of type-I error control, significant intervals can be selected by thresholding the two p-value functions at level α. We prove that the unadjusted (adjusted) p-value function point-wise (interval-wise) controls the probability of type-I error and it is point-wise (interval-wise) consistent. To enlighten the gain in terms of interpretation of the phenomenon under study, we applied the interval-wise testing to the analysis of a benchmark functional data set, i.e. Canadian daily temperatures. The new procedure provides insights that current state-of-the-art procedures do not, supporting similar advantages in the analysis of functional data with less prior knowledge.},

Differences between centerings and their potential interaction can be easily misunderstood. We propose a unified framework and new terminology for centering operations. We clearly demonstrate the intuition behind and consequences of each centering choice with informative graphics. We also propose a new direction energy hypothesis test as part of a series of diagnostics for determining which choice of centering is best for a data set.

Included are expressions in the functional domain of such classics as linear regression, principal components analysis, linear modeling, and canonical correlation analysis, as well as specifically functional techniques such as curve registration and principal differential analysis. Data arising in real applications are used throughout for both motivation and illustration, showing how functional approaches allow us to see new things, especially by exploiting the smoothness of the processes generating the data. The data sets exemplify the wide scope of functional data analysis; they are drawn from growth analysis, meteorology, biomechanics, equine science, economics, and medicine. The book presents novel statistical technology, much of it based on the authors’ own research work, while keeping the mathematical level widely accessible. It is designed to appeal to students, to applied data analysts, and to experienced researchers; it will have value both within statistics and across a broad spectrum of other fields.  This second edition is aimed at a wider range of readers, and especially those who would like to apply these techniques to their research problems. It complements the authors' other recent volume Applied Functional Data Analysis: Methods and Case Studies. In particular, there is an extended coverage of data smoothing and other matters arising in the preliminaries to a functional data analysis. The chapters on the functional linear model and modeling of the dynamics of systems through the use of differential equations and principal differential analysis have been completely rewritten and extended to include new developments. Other chapters have been revised substantially, often to give more weight to examples and practical considerations.

The extension of classical data analytic techniques designed forp-variate observations to such data is discussed. The essential step is the expression of the classical problem in the language of functional analysis, after which the extension to functions is a straightforward matter. A schematic device called the duality diagram is a very useful tool for describing an analysis and for suggesting new possibilities. Least squares approximation, descriptive statistics, principal components analysis, and canonical correlation analysis are discussed within this broader framework.},

In the special case of linear processes, we determine the analytical expressions for the spectral density operators of functional autoregressive (fractionally integrated) moving average processes, and leverage these as part of our spectral approach, leading to substantial improvements over time-domain simulation methods in some cases. The methods are implemented as an R package (specsimfts) accompanied by several demo files that are easy to modify and can be easily used by researchers aiming to probe the finite-sample performance of their functional time series methodology by means of simulation.},

RPE, PO and HR data was collected from twelve professional cyclists (VO2max 75~±~6~ml∙min∙kg-1) during a two-week baseline training period and during two cycling Grand Tours. Subjective:objective intensity (RPE:HR, RPE:PO) and load (sRPE:iTRIMP, sRPE:TSS) ratios and external:internal intensity (PO:HR) and load (TSS:iTRIMP) ratios were calculated for every session. Moderate to large increases in the RPE:HR, RPE:PO and sRPE:TSS ratios (d~=~0.79-1.79) and small increases in the PO:HR and sRPE:iTRIMP ratio (d~=~0.21-0.41) were observed during Grand Tours compared to baseline training data. Differences in the TSS:iTRIMP ratio were trivial to small (d~=~0.03-0.27). Small to moderate week-to-week changes (d~=~0.21-0.63) in the PO:HR, RPE:PO, RPE:HR, TSS:iTRIMP, sRPE:iTRIMP and sRPE:TSS were observed during the Grand Tour. Concluding, this study shows the value of using ratios of intensity and load measures in monitoring cyclists. Increases in ratios could reflect progressive fatigue that is not readily detected by changes in solitary intensity/load measures.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To provide a retrospective analysis of a large competition database describing the intensity and load demands of professional road-cycling races, highlighting the differences between men's and women's races. METHODS: In total, 20 male and 10 female professional cyclists participated in this study. During 4 consecutive years, heart rate, rating of perceived exertion, and power-output data were collected during both men's (n\,=\,3024) and women's (n\,=\,667) professional races. Intensity distribution in 5 heart-rate zones was quantified. Competition load was calculated using different metrics, including Training Stress Score (TSS), training impulse (TRIMP), and session rating of perceived exertion. Standardized effect size is reported as Cohen d. RESULTS: Large to very large higher values (d\,=\,1.36-2.86) were observed for distance, duration, total work (in kilojoules), and mean power output in men's races. Time spent in high-intensity heart-rate zones (ie,~zones 4 and 5) was largely higher in women's races (d\,=\,1.38-1.55) than in men's races. Small higher loads were observed in men's races quantified using TSS (d\,=\,0.53) and TRIMP (d\,=\,0.23). However, load metrics expressed per kilometer were large to very largely higher in women's races for TSS·km-1 (d\,=\,1.50) and TRIMP·km-1 (d\,=\,2.31). CONCLUSIONS: Volume and absolute load are higher in men's races, whereas intensity and time spent in high-intensity zones is higher in women's races. Coaches and practitioners should consider these differences in demands in the preparation of professional road cyclists.},

  abstract = {Purpose: To assess the dose-response relationships between different training-load methods and aerobic fitness and performance in competitive road cyclists. Methods: Training data from 15 well-trained competitive cyclists were collected during a 10-wk (December–March) preseason training period. Before and after the training period, participants underwent a laboratory incremental exercise test with gas-exchange and lactate measures and a performance assessment using an 8-min time trial (8MT). Internal training load was calculated using Banister TRIMP, Edwards TRIMP, individualized TRIMP (iTRIMP), Lucia TRIMP (luTRIMP), and session rating of perceived exertion (sRPE). External load was measured using Training Stress Score (TSS). Results: Large to very large relationships (r = .54–.81) between training load and changes in submaximal fitness variables (power at 2 and 4 mmol/L) were observed for all training-load calculation methods. The strongest relationships with changes in aerobic fitness variables were observed for iTRIMP (r = .81 [95\% CI .51–.93, r = .77 [95\% CI .43–.92]) and TSS (r = .75 [95\% CI .31–.93], r = .79 [95\% CI .40–.94]). The strongest dose-response relationships with changes in the 8MT test were observed for iTRIMP (r = .63 [95\% CI .17–.86]) and luTRIMP (r = .70 [95\% CI .29–.89). Conclusions: Training-load quantification methods that integrate individual physiological characteristics have the strongest dose-response relationships, suggesting this to be an essential factor in the quantification of training load in cycling.},

Wellness data, which are often ordinal and multivariate, include metrics relating to the physical, mental, and emotional status of the athlete. Training and recovery can have significant short- and long-term effects on athlete wellness, and these effects can vary across individual. We develop a joint multivariate latent factor model for ordinal response data to investigate the effects of training and recovery on athlete wellness. We use a latent factor distributed lag model to capture the cumulative effects of training and recovery through time. Current efforts using subjective wellness data have averaged over these metrics to create a univariate summary of wellness, however this approach can mask important information in the data. Our multivariate model leverages each ordinal variable and can be used to identify the relative importance of each in monitoring athlete wellness. The model is applied to professional referee daily wellness, training, and recovery data collected across two Major League Soccer seasons.},

To this end, a novel clustering technique for multivariate functional data is presented. This method is based on a func- tional latent mixture model which fits the data in group-specific functional subspaces through a multivariate functional principal component analysis. A family of parsimonious models is obtained by constraining model parameters within and between groups. An EM algorithm is proposed for model inference and the choice of hyper-parameters is addressed through model selection. Nu- merical experiments on simulated datasets highlight the good performance of the proposed methodology compared to existing works. This algorithm is then applied to the analysis of the pollution in French cities for one year.},

  abstract = {Numerical modeling of non-inertial particles dynamics is usually addressed by solving a population balance equation (PBE). In addition to space and time, a discretization is required also in the particle-size space, covering a large range of variation controlled by strongly nonlinear phenomena. A novel approach is presented in which a hybrid stochastic/fixed-sectional method solving the PBE is used to train a combination of an artificial neural network (ANN) with a convolutional neural network (CNN) and recurrent long short-term memory artificial neural layers. The hybrid stochastic/fixed-sectional method decomposes the problem into the total number density and the probability density function of sizes, allowing for an accurate treatment of surface growth/loss. After solving for the transport of species and temperature, the input of the ANN is composed of the thermochemical parameters controlling the particle physics and of the increment in time. The input of the CNN is the shape of the particle size distribution (PSD) discretized in sections of size. From these inputs, in a flow simulation, the ANN–CNN returns the PSD shape for the subsequent time step or a source term for the Eulerian transport of the particle size density. The method is evaluated in a canonical laminar premixed sooting flame of the literature, and for a given level of accuracy (i.e., a given discretization of the size space), a significant computing cost reduction is achieved (six times faster compared to a sectional method with ten sections and 30 times faster for 100 sections).},

They are applied with increasing frequency across a wide range of disciplines, including chemical engineering, aerosol physics, astrophysics, polymer science, pharmaceutical sciences, and mathematical biology. Population balance models are used to track particle properties and their changes due to aggregation, fragmentation, nucleation and growth, processes that directly affect the distribution of particle sizes. The population balance equation is an integro-partial differential equation whose domain is the line of positive real numbers. This poses challenges for the stability and accuracy of the numerical methods used to solve for size distribution function and in response to these challenges several different methodologies have been developed in the literature. This review provides a critical presentation of the state of the art in numerical approaches for solving these complex models with emphasis in the algorithmic details that distinguish each methodology. The review covers finite volume methods, Monte Carlo method and sectional methods; the method of moments, another important numerical methodology, is not covered in this review.},

In particular, our unsupervised method can capture important latent factors to explain variability of the dataset, which can induce a clear distinction between important variables in the principal components and unnecessary features based on the sparseness structure. Furthermore, our method can be applied to functional data from a multidimensional domain that hinges on different intervals. In the numerical experiment, we show that our method works well in both low- and high-dimensional multivariate functional data regardless of the number and the type of basis.

  abstract = {A general formulation for the statistical description of time-dependent multiple particle breakage processes is presented in terms of a purposely constructed dimensionless quantity that contains the main physical magnitudes involved in the problem. The approach combines the Tsallis non-extensive entropy with a kinetic equation with fractionary index for the time evolution of the size/mass of the fragments. The obtained distribution function is tested by fitting some experimental reports. It is found that the better adjustment corresponds, in all cases, to values of the time index equal or below 0.6, whereas the parameter of nonextensivity ranks between 1 and 2, as previously reported in other studies involving some kind of fragmentation. The work could be the first example of a non-extensive maximum-entropy statistical description based on a purposely constructed dimensionless quantity, as well as of the derivation of a fragment size distribution function explicitly dependent on measurable system variables. As a result, the role of quantities such as viscosity, velocity gradient and others becomes explicit in the formulation.},

  abstract = {STUDY QUESTION: What variations underlie the menstrual cycle length and ovulation day of women trying to conceive? SUMMARY ANSWER: Big data from a connected ovulation test revealed the extent of variation in menstrual cycle length and ovulation day in women trying to conceive. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Timing intercourse to coincide with the fertile period of a woman maximises the chances of conception. The day of ovulation varies on an inter- and intra-individual level. STUDY DESIGN SIZE DURATION: A total of 32\,595 women who had purchased a connected ovulation test system contributed 75\,981~cycles for analysis. Day of ovulation was determined from the fertility test results. The connected home ovulation test system enables users to identify their fertile phase. The app benefits users by enabling them to understand their personal fertility information. During each menstrual cycle, users input their perceived cycle length into an accessory application, and data on hormone levels from the tests are uploaded to the application and stored in an anonymised cloud database. This study compared users' perceived cycle characteristics with actual cycle characteristics. The perceived and actual cycle length information was analysed to provide population ranges. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS SETTING METHODS: This study analysed data from the at-home use of a commercially available connected home ovulation test by women across the USA and UK. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Overall, 25.3\% of users selected a 28-day cycle as their perceived cycle length; however, only 12.4\% of users actually had a 28-day cycle. Most women (87\%) had actual menstrual cycle lengths between 23 and 35~days, with a normal distribution centred on day 28, and over half of the users (52\%) had cycles that varied by 5~days or more. There was a 10-day spread of observed ovulation days for a 28-day cycle, with the most common day of ovulation being Day 15. Similar variation was observed for all cycle lengths examined. For users who conducted a test on every day requested by the app, a luteinising hormone (LH) surge was detected in 97.9\% of cycles. LIMITATIONS REASONS FOR CAUTION: Data were from a self-selected population of women who were prepared to purchase a commercially available product to aid conception and so may not fully represent the wider population. No corresponding demographic data were collected with the cycle information. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Using big data has provided more personalised insights into women's fertility; this could enable women trying to conceive to better time intercourse, increasing the likelihood of conception. STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTERESTS: The study was funded by SPD Development Company Ltd (Bedford, UK), a fully owned subsidiary of SPD Swiss Precision Diagnostics GmbH (Geneva, Switzerland).

  abstract = {A quantitative analysis of human gait patterns in space–time provides an opportunity to observe variability within and across individuals of varying motor capabilities. Impaired gait significantly affects independence and quality of life, and thus a large part of clinical research is dedicated to improving gait through rehabilitative therapies. Evaluation of these paradigms relies on understanding the characteristic differences in the kinematics and underlying biomechanics of impaired and unimpaired locomotion, which has motivated quantitative measurement and analysis of the gait cycle. Previous analysis has largely been limited to a statistical comparison of manually selected pointwise metrics identified through expert knowledge. Here, we use a recent statistical-geometric framework, elastic functional data analysis (FDA), to decompose kinematic data into continuous ‘amplitude’ (spatial) and ‘phase’ (temporal) components, which can then be integrated with established dimensionality reduction techniques. We demonstrate the utility of elastic FDA through two unsupervised applications to post-stroke gait datasets. First, we distinguish between unimpaired, paretic and non-paretic gait presentations. Then, we use FDA to reveal robust, interpretable groups of differential response to exosuit assistance. The proposed methods aim to benefit clinical practice for post-stroke gait rehabilitation, and more broadly, to automate the quantitative analysis of motion.},

  abstract = {Modelling and forecasting homogeneous age-specific mortality rates of multiple countries could lead to improvements in long-term forecasting. Data fed into joint models are often grouped according to nominal attributes, such as geographic regions, ethnic groups, and socioeconomic status, which may still contain heterogeneity and deteriorate the forecast results. Our paper proposes a novel clustering technique to pursue homogeneity among multiple functional time series based on functional panel data modelling to address this issue. Using a functional panel data model with fixed effects, we can extract common functional time series features. These common features could be decomposed into two components: the functional time trend and the mode of variations of functions (functional pattern). The functional time trend reflects the dynamics across time, while the functional pattern captures the fluctuations within curves. The proposed clustering method searches for homogeneous age-specific mortality rates of multiple countries by accounting for both the modes of variations and the temporal dynamics among curves. We demonstrate that the proposed clustering technique outperforms other existing methods through a Monte Carlo simulation and could handle complicated cases with slow decaying eigenvalues. In empirical data analysis, we find that the clustering results of age-specific mortality rates can be explained by the combination of geographic region, ethnic groups, and socioeconomic status. We further show that our model produces more accurate forecasts than several benchmark methods in forecasting age-specific mortality rates.},

  abstract = {The main factors for home advantage (HA), quantified by the number of points won at home expressed as a percentage of all points, are believed to be crowd support, territoriality, familiarity, and travel fatigue. In 2020, the German Soccer Bundesliga interrupted its championship due to the Covid-19 pandemic after 25 rounds and the last nine rounds were played without audience. This unique situation allowed studying the effect of spectators on the team's performance and the referee's decisions. We hypothesized a decrease in HA and a more balanced distribution of fouls and disciplinary cards in the games without audience (GWOA) compared to the games with audience (GWA). We evaluated n = 223 GWA and n = 83 GWOA of the season 2019/20 and all games of the preceding season 2018/19 to analyze the distribution of game outcomes (wins, losses, and draws) and HA. We analyzed the number of fouls, disciplinary cards, and penalty kicks. We found significant differences in HA between GWA (HA = 54.35\%) and GWOA (HA = 44.1\%) as well as GWOA and games of 2018/19 (HA = 57.63\%). The distribution of game outcomes in GWOA did not differ from GWA but differed significantly from 2018/19 (p = 0.031). The distribution of fouls showed a significant difference to equal distribution in GWA [home: 2,595 (48.56\%); away: 2,749 (51.44\%)] but not in GWOA [home: 1,067 (50.54\%); away: 1,044 (49.46\%)]. In the GWOA, we counted 178 (51.1\%, home) and 170 (48.9\%, away) cards, representing a significant difference in the distribution to GWA [home: 405 (44.85\%); away: 498 (55.15\%)]. The number of red cards differed significantly from an equal distribution for GWA (14 home and 28 away) but not for GWOA (eight home and seven away). In the last nine rounds without audience, we observed more home losses (36) than home wins (27). Hence, the Covid-19 lock-down led to a home disadvantage. One reason for this surprising result could be that the home team is missing an important familiar aspect when playing in their empty stadium without social support from their home audience. Furthermore, both teams know about the HA thus the away team could be more motivated in this unusual situation.},

  abstract = {With the advance of modern technology, more and more data are being recorded continuously during a time interval or intermittently at several discrete time points. These are both examples of functional data, which has become a commonly encountered type of data. Functional data analysis (FDA) encompasses the statistical methodology for such data. Broadly interpreted, FDA deals with the analysis and theory of data that are in the form of functions. This paper provides an overview of FDA, starting with simple statistical notions such as mean and covariance functions, then covering some core techniques, the most popular of which is functional principal component analysis (FPCA). FPCA is an important dimension reduction tool, and in sparse data situations it can be used to impute functional data that are sparsely observed. Other dimension reduction approaches are also discussed. In addition, we review another core technique, functional linear regression, as well as clustering and classification of functional data. Beyond linear and single- or multiple- index methods, we touch upon a few nonlinear approaches that are promising for certain applications. They include additive and other nonlinear functional regression models and models that feature time warping, manifold learning, and empirical differential equations. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of future directions.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether irregular or long menstrual cycles throughout the life course are associated with all cause and cause specific premature mortality (age {$<$}70 years). DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Nurses' Health Study II (1993-2017). PARTICIPANTS: 79\,505 premenopausal women without a history of cardiovascular disease, cancer, or diabetes and who reported the usual length and regularity of their menstrual cycles at ages 14-17 years, 18-22 years, and 29-46 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Hazard ratios and 95\% confidence intervals for all cause and cause specific premature mortality (death before age 70 years) were estimated from multivariable Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: During 24 years of follow-up, 1975 premature deaths were documented, including 894 from cancer and 172 from cardiovascular disease. Women who reported always having irregular menstrual cycles experienced higher mortality rates during follow-up than women who reported very regular cycles in the same age ranges. The crude mortality rate per 1000 person years of follow-up for women reporting very regular cycles and women reporting always irregular cycles were 1.05 and 1.23 for cycle characteristics at ages 14-17 years, 1.00 and 1.37 for cycle characteristics at ages 18-22 years, and 1.00 and 1.68 for cycle characteristics at ages 29-46 years. The corresponding multivariable adjusted hazard ratios for premature death during follow-up were 1.18 (95\% confidence interval 1.02 to 1.37), 1.37 (1.09 to 1.73), and 1.39 (1.14 to 1.70), respectively. Similarly, women who reported that their usual cycle length was 40 days or more at ages 18-22 years and 29-46 years were more likely to die prematurely than women who reported a usual cycle length of 26-31 days in the same age ranges (1.34, 1.06 to 1.69; and 1.40, 1.17 to 1.68, respectively). These relations were strongest for deaths related to cardiovascular disease. The higher mortality associated with long and irregular menstrual cycles was slightly stronger among current smokers. CONCLUSIONS: Irregular and long menstrual cycles in adolescence and adulthood are associated with a greater risk of premature mortality (age {$<$}70 years). This relation is slightly stronger among women who smoke.},

The method introduces a radial basis function network to approximate the number density function. The approximate solution should satisfy the PBE at the collocation points in a continuous manner. The coagulation terms in the PBE are directly handled using the Gaussian quadrature techniques. The final solution is a bivariant analytical function of particle volume and time, which can be easily used in any subsequent calculation. Then the method is validated by comparing with analytical solutions and the sectional method for four numerical test problems. These problems are selected to vary in coagulation kernels and initial conditions. The comparative results show that the present method can accurately predict the time evolution of the number density function. Moreover, the computational efficiency of the present method is quite acceptable considering the high accuracy.Copyright © 2020 American Association for Aerosol Research},

The presence of differences between athletes in such variables has led to terms such as movement signatures being used. These signatures can be multivariate (multiple time-series observed concurrently), and also be composed of variables measured relative to different scales. Analytical techniques from areas of statistics such as Functional Data Analysis (FDA) present a practical alternative for analysing multivariate signatures. When applied to concurrent bivariate time-series multivariate functional principal components analysis (referred to as bivariate fPCA or bfPCA in this paper) has demonstrated preliminary application in biomechanical contexts. Despite this, given the infancy of bfPCA in sports biomechanics there are still necessary considerations for its use with non-conventional or complex bivariate structures. This paper focuses on the application of bfPCA to the force-angle graph in on-water rowing, which is a bivariate structure composed of variables with different units. A normalisation approach is proposed to investigate and standardise differences in variability between the two variables. The results of bfPCA applied to the non-normalised data and normalised data are then compared. Considerations and recommendations for the application of bfPCA in this context are also provided.},

Essentially, the method is based on the backward form of the Chapman-Kolmogoroff equation and is closely related to the theory of fluctuations in nuclear reactors. A probability balance equation is derived and converted to a more convenient form using a generating function. Some new multi-particle breakup functions are introduced and their properties discussed. It is shown that the mean value equation is identical to that conventionally used for grinding but the equations for the variance and higher moments are new. In a special case, we are able to solve the nonlinear, partial integro-differential equation for the generating function and construct the complete probability distribution of the particle number in a given size range. The method can also be employed to study fibre breakup, of interest in the paper industry, and polymer degradation; it therefore has a wide range of application.},

  abstract = {In functional data analysis (FDA), the covariance function is fundamental not only as a critical quantity for understanding elementary aspects of functional data but also as an indispensable ingredient for many advanced FDA methods. A new class of nonparametric covariance function estimators in terms of various spectral regularizations of an operator associated with a reproducing kernel Hilbert space is developed. Despite their nonparametric nature, the covariance estimators are automatically positive semi-definite, which is an essential property of covariance functions, via a one-step procedure. An unconventional representer theorem is established to provide a finite dimensional representation for this class of covariance estimators based on data, although the solutions are searched over infinite dimensional functional spaces. To further achieve a low-rank representation, another desirable property, e.g., for dimension reduction and easy interpretation, the trace-norm regularization is particularly studied, under which an efficient algorithm is developed based on the accelerated proximal gradient method. The outstanding practical performance of the trace-norm-regularized covariance estimator is demonstrated by a simulation study and the analysis of a traffic dataset. Under both fixed and random designs, an excellent rate of convergence is established for a broad class of operator-regularized covariance function estimators, which generalizes both the trace-norm-regularized covariance estimator and other popular alternatives.},

  abstract = {Aiming at quantifying the dependence of pairs of functional data (X, Y), we develop the concept of functional singular value decomposition for covariance and functional singular component analysis, building on the concept of 'canonical expansion' of compact operators in functional analysis. We demonstrate the estimation of the resulting singular values, functions and components for the practically relevant case of sparse and noise-contaminated longitudinal data and provide asymptotic consistency results. Expanding bivariate functional data into singular functions emerges as a natural extension of the popular functional principal component analysis for single processes to the case of paired processes. A natural application of the functional singular value decomposition is a measure of functional correlation. Owing to the involvement of an inverse operation, most previously considered functional correlation measures are plagued by numerical instabilities and strong sensitivity to the choice of smoothing parameters. These problems are exacerbated for the case of sparse longitudinal data, on which we focus. The functional correlation measure that is derived from the functional singular value decomposition behaves well with respect to numerical stability and statistical error, as we demonstrate in a simulation study. Practical feasibility for applications to longitudinal data is illustrated with examples from a study on aging and on-line auctions.},

  abstract = {We propose a nonparametric method to perform functional principal components analysis for the case of sparse longitudinal data. The method aims at irregularly spaced longitudinal data, where the number of repeated measurements available per subject is small. In contrast, classical functional data analysis requires a large number of regularly spaced measurements per subject. We assume that the repeated measurements are located randomly with a random number of repetitions for each subject and are determined by an underlying smooth random (subject-specific) trajectory plus measurement errors. Basic elements of our approach are the parsimonious estimation of the covariance structure and mean function of the trajectories, and the estimation of the variance of the measurement errors. The eigenfunction basis is estimated from the data, and functional principal components score estimates are obtained by a conditioning step. This conditional estimation method is conceptually simple and straightforward to implement. A key step is the derivation of asymptotic consistency and distribution results under mild conditions, using tools from functional analysis. Functional data analysis for sparse longitudinal data enables prediction of individual smooth trajectories even if only one or few measurements are available for a subject. Asymptotic pointwise and simultaneous confidence bands are obtained for predicted individual trajectories, based on asymptotic distributions, for simultaneous bands under the assumption of a finite number of components. Model selection techniques, such as the Akaike information criterion, are used to choose the model dimension corresponding to the number of eigenfunctions in the model. The methods are illustrated with a simulation study, longitudinal CD4 data for a sample of AIDS patients, and time-course gene expression data for the yeast cell cycle.},

  abstract = {The article describes a new methodology for the emulation of high-order, dynamic simulation models. This exploits the technique of dominant mode analysis to identify a reduced-order, linear transfer function model that closely reproduces the linearized dynamic behavior of the large model. Based on a set of such reduced-order models, identified over a specified region of the large model's parameter space, nonparametric regression, tensor product cubic spline smoothing, or Gaussian process emulation are used to construct a computationally efficient, low-order, dynamic emulation (or meta) model that can replace the large model in applications such as sensitivity analysis, forecasting, or control system design. Two modes of emulation are possible, one of which allows for novel 'stand-alone' operation that replicates the dynamic behavior of the large simulation model over any time horizon and any sequence of the forcing inputs. Two examples demonstrate the practical utility of the proposed technique and supplementary materials, available online and including Matlab code, provide a background to the methods of transfer function model identification and estimation used in the article.},

  abstract = {The objective of the present study was to formulate a simple and at the same time effective mathematical model of heart rate kinetics in response to movement (exercise). Based on an existing model, a system of two coupled differential equations which give the rate of change of heart rate and the rate of change of exercise intensity is used. The modifications introduced to the existing model are justified and discussed in detail, while models of blood lactate accumulation in respect to time and exercise intensity are also presented. The main modification is that the proposed model has now only one parameter which reflects the overall cardiovascular condition of the individual. The time elapsed after the beginning of the exercise, the intensity of the exercise, as well as blood lactate are also taken into account. Application of the model provides information regarding the individual’s cardiovascular condition and is able to detect possible changes in it, across the data recording periods. To demonstrate examples of successful numerical fit of the model, constant intensity experimental heart rate data sets of two individuals have been selected and numerical optimization was implemented. In addition, numerical simulations provided predictions for various exercise intensities and various cardiovascular condition levels. The proposed model can serve as a powerful tool for a complete means of heart rate analysis, not only in exercise physiology (for efficiently designing training sessions for healthy subjects) but also in the areas of cardiovascular health and rehabilitation (including application in population groups for which direct heart rate recordings at intense exercises are not possible or not allowed, such as elderly or pregnant women).},

  abstract = {With modern technology development, functional data are being observed frequently in many scientific fields. A popular method for analyzing such functional data is “smoothing first, then estimation.” That is, statistical inference such as estimation and hypothesis testing about functional data is conducted based on the substitution of the underlying individual functions by their reconstructions obtained by one smoothing technique or another. However, little is known about this substitution effect on functional data analysis. In this paper this problem is investigated when the local polynomial kernel (LPK) smoothing technique is used for individual function reconstructions. We find that under some mild conditions, the substitution effect can be ignored asymptotically. Based on this, we construct LPK reconstruction-based estimators for the mean, covariance and noise variance functions of a functional data set and derive their asymptotics. We also propose a GCV rule for selecting good bandwidths for the LPK reconstructions. When the mean function also depends on some time-independent covariates, we consider a functional linear model where the mean function is linearly related to the covariates but the covariate effects are functions of time. The LPK reconstruction-based estimators for the covariate effects and the covariance function are also constructed and their asymptotics are derived. Moreover, we propose a L2-norm-based global test statistic for a general hypothesis testing problem about the covariate effects and derive its asymptotic random expression. The effect of the bandwidths selected by the proposed GCV rule on the accuracy of the LPK reconstructions and the mean function estimator is investigated via a simulation study. The proposed methodologies are illustrated via an application to a real functional data set collected in climatology.},
