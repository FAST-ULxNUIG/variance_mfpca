\begin{itemize}
    \item This should be a quick paper on the selection of the number of components for MFPCA.
    \item Based on how the number of components is selected in MFPCA \cite{happMultivariateFunctionalPrincipal2018a}.
    \item Just considering the number of components, based on an univariate expansion, we speculate that we need for that say $K$ univariate components to effectively estimate $K$ multivariate components.
    \item The same phenomenon appears with the percentage of variance explained, we can not retrieve $\alpha\%$ of the variance with the multivariate curves, if the univariate components also explained $\alpha\%$ of the univariate curves. This might be related to the ``multivariate testing'' phenomena.
    \item This is going to be a practical paper, no proof, except pratical proofs will be presented here. Only work on extensive simulations.
